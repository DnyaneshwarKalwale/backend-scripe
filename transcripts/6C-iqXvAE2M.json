  "transcript": "[Music] \n Good  morning,  I'm  back  in \n Paris.  I  was  very  sick,  and  I  want  to \n invite  you  to  join  me  at  the \n Moncller  fitting.   We  are  in  Cuchevel,  it  is \n beautifully  cold,  I  love  it. \n [Music] \n Ah,  this  one's  nice  too,  huh?   I \n hadn't  seen  this  one.   Ah,  look,  they've \n read  my  mind. \n Yes,  yes,  yes. \n [Music] \n Sure,  but  they  have  to  cut  it.   He \n has  his  finger \n [Music] \n this  is  what  he's  going  to  wear  because \n everyone  wears  wool  with  their  hair.   So, \n this is \n now  a \n coffee.   If  there  was  a \n chorizo ​​ toast  I  would  eat  it,  since  I  have \n n't  eaten  Iberian  products  in  a  long  time. \n [Music] \n Oh,  please. \n Bye,  my  friend.   Have  a  good  day.   Let's  see \n how  the  kids  are.   My  mom  is  already \n writing  to  me  that  I've  put  them  on \n cross-country  skiing  because  I'm  scared  they'll \n break  a  leg  or  something,  I'm \n worried.   And  then  you  saw  these  people \n skiing  like  this,  you  said,  skiing  all  the  way  down, \n right?   So  you're  going  to  try  the  pine \n for  the  first  time  today. \n [Music] \n How  exciting.   How  strong.   You're  going  to  parade. \n You  are  not  aware  yet  that  you  are  not.   Very \n good.   Hey, \n [Applause] \n you  look  very  pretty.   See  you  now.   Who's \n speaking? \n We  are  backstage  at  Montclir. \n Now  they'll  come  and  finish  preparing  my \n look.   And  it's  snowing.   I'm  super \n excited  because  it  makes  me  think  of  my \n birthdays  and  when  I  was  little.   It \n seems  to  me  like  a  gift  from  the  universe.   Another  one. \n And  then  it  was  a  little \n longer.   It's  perfect.   What  number \n am  I  on?   69. \n [Music] \n [Music] \n You  don't  know  where  the  yellow  one  is.   No, \n I  didn't  stop  to  put  on  my  hat. \n Careful,  careful,  chorina. \n [Music] \n Dominica  ran  away  because \n I  was  lost.    There  was  a \n lack  of  air. \n Tonight  I  got  red.   It  said  that \n blood  oxygen  has  decreased  due  to \n altitude.   The  clock  has  already  marked  it  for  me. \n [Music] \n Oh,  my  lungs. \n [Music] I \n don't  really  like  the \n altitude  climb  in \n this  snow,  right?   Yeah,  it \n couldn't  be  better. \n There  are  gaps  between  people. \n You  have  to  go  faster,  but  I  can't \n do  any  more,  okay?   But  your  comparison  is \n faster,  it  doesn't  give  me  more. \n [Music] \n We  had  to  modify  my  hairstyle \n because  during  rehearsal  my  strands \n got  soaked  with  snow,  so  everything  was \n brushed  back  and \n [Music] \n perfect.   We  are  here  waiting  for  the \n parade  to  start. \n [Music] \n [Music] \n Georgina, \n what?   Are  you  dead?   Yes,  I'm \n still  recovering  from  pneumonia. \n Yes,  yes,  yes.   I  got  into  the  role,  I \n lowered  my  neck,  raised  my \n head,  I  say,  for  forward.   Good. \n Well,  my  loves,  the  parade  was \n amazing.   The  airport,  all  the  staff \n who  were  there  with  supermodels,  has  started  to \n snow  with  a  very  special  force  for \n me.   I'm  super  happy. \n and  we'll  see  each  other  tomorrow,  okay?   If  it  stops \n snowing,  then  I'll  ski,  and  if  it  doesn't,  then  I'll  look.",
