  "transcript": "This  is  the  new \n Insta360X5.  It's  probably  the  single \n biggest  improvement  I've  ever  seen  to  a \n 360째  camera.  So,  I  did  the  only  logical \n thing.  I  flew  5,000  mi  across  two  time \n zones  to  the  Moldes  to  find  out  both  why \n you  would  ever  use  something  like  this \n if  you  can  just  use  your  phone  to  shoot, \n but  also  what  does  this  new  camera  do \n that  the  company's  existing  360  cameras \n couldn't  already  do?  So,  thanks  to  Insta \n for  sponsoring  and  getting  us  super \n early  access.  Let's  very  literally  dive \n in.  So,  the  entire  purpose  of  a  360째 \n camera  is  unlike  shooting  with  your \n phone,  where  you  have  to  focus  on  what \n you're  capturing,  and  if  you  miss \n something,  then  too  bad.  This  captures  a \n 360째  sphere  of  video  so  that  you  never \n miss  anything,  and  you  can  decide  later \n what  bits  you  want  to  focus  on  while \n being  able  to  make  the  selfie  stick \n completely  disappear  from  your  footage. \n But  that's  what  360  cameras  have  always \n done.  So,  what  is  actually  new  here? \n Well,  if  you've  paid  a  lot  of  attention \n to  the  smartphone  market  these  days, \n then  you'll  probably  be  aware  that  we'd \n be  lucky  to  get  a  20%  improvement  to  one \n of  the  camera  sensors  on  them.  Do  you \n know  what  they've  done  here?  Each  camera \n on  the  X5  has  a  144%  larger  sensor  than \n the  already  9  out  of  10  rated  X4  camera \n from  just  last  year,  which  is  such  a \n boost  to  video  quality  that  the  second \n you  start  recording  with  the  thing,  it's \n like  you're  shooting  with  four  different \n cameras  simultaneously  because  you're \n capturing  all  angles  at  once.  And  now  in \n such  high  resolution,  8K,  which  Insta3 \n then  processes  in  11K  using  something \n called  super  sampling.  It  means  each \n individual  viewpoint  is  almost  the \n equivalent  of  a  full  phone  camera's \n image.  Just  to  be  clear,  you're \n capturing  all  of  this  in  one  go  in  one \n shot.  There  is  an  even  bigger  perk  that \n comes  with  this  quality  upgrade,  but \n we're  getting  there.  Because  before \n that,  you  will  almost  definitely  notice \n number  seven,  the  audio  upgrade.  So, \n here's  the  thing  with  recording  on \n phones.  I  think  the  iPhone  to  be  honest \n is  a  fantastic  starting  camera  and  the \n sound  quality  is  incredible  on  it.  But \n where  it  starts  to  break  down  is  when \n you're  trying  to  use  it  for  extreme \n conditions  that  it  just  wasn't  designed \n for.  So  let's  say  for  example  that  I  am \n in  about  5  minutes  going  to  be \n absolutely  pacing  it  on  this  jet  ski. \n Phone  microphones  aren't  designed  to  be \n able  to  block  out  wind  noise.  So  your \n end  clear  is  going  to  sound  like  this. \n The  X5  is  designed  with  all  of  this \n stuff  in  mind.  So,  it's  just  naturally \n going  to  sound  a  lot  better.  It's  partly \n down  to  software,  but  it's  mostly  just \n that  Insta  have  had  the  space  here  to \n put  in  a  proper  physical  multi-layer \n steel  mesh  wind  guard.  But  what  if  you \n accidentally  drop  the  thing  while  you're \n on  your  high-speed \n adventures?  There's  no  brakes  on  this \n bike.  Oh \n god.  Right.  I  nearly  fulled  myself  into \n the  water.  Well,  one  of  the  key  bits  of \n feedback  that  Insta  360  have  been \n getting  over  the  years  is  lenses  are \n fragile.  And  so,  there's  been  a  lot  of \n users  saying,  \"I  feel  like  I  should  play \n it  safe  with  my  camera  as  opposed  to \n getting  the  exact  shot  that  I  want.\"  So, \n Insta  have  tried  a  bunch  of  things  to \n address  that.  Like  last  year,  they \n started  including  these  free  lens  guards \n with  the  product,  but  this,  I  think,  is \n the  ultimate  solution.  With  the  X5,  you \n can  actually  just  swap  out  the  lens \n entirely  if  anything  happens.  And  you \n can  do  it  yourself.  Like,  imagine  how \n crazy  it  would  be  if  you  could  do  that \n on  your  phone.  Like  just  unscrew  your \n lens  and  put  a  new  one  in  if  you  scratch \n it  or  chip  it.  And  that  is  also  paired \n with  even  stronger  glass  on  the  lenses \n themselves.  It's  not  sapphire,  but  it's \n sapphire  level  durability  now  thanks  to \n a  new  diamondlike  coating  process. \n Literally  100%  stronger  than  on  the  X4. \n And  the  other  side  to  that  durability \n coin  is  waterproofing.  Insta3  have \n essentially  gone  around  the  entire \n design  and  targeted  all  the  points  of \n vulnerability  like  the  USBC  port,  which \n means  that  instead  of  the  previous \n ability  to  withstand  10  m  depths,  this \n can  now  handle  15  m.  For  context,  by  the \n way,  an  iPhone  16  Pro  Max  could  survive \n theoretically  about  6  m.  But  you'd  also \n have  a  bunch  of  other  issues  crop  up \n like  your  screen  going  haywire  and \n saltwater  just  causing  long-term  damage \n internally.  Seeing  the  progress  in \n battery  has  been  quite  insane,  too.  The \n first  360  camera  these  guys  came  out \n with,  the  1X,  had  a  60minute  runtime. \n That  then  went  up  to  80,  then  all  the \n way  to  135  and  now  it  is  sitting  at  185 \n minutes.  You  do  still  have  to  use \n endurance  mode  to  get  that  battery  life, \n but  we  are  still  talking  185minut \n runtime  while  shooting  in  360째  5.7K \n quality,  plus  fast  charging,  which  is \n not  something  that  you  tend  to  see \n camera  companies  focusing  on,  but  this \n thing  gets  up  to  about  80%  in  20 \n minutes.  Now,  one  thing  that  you  can \n just  tell  this  company's  been  thinking \n about  with  this  generation  is  how  do  we \n design  this  camera  to  be  appealing  to \n people  for  who  the  only  other  camera \n they've  ever  used  is  just  their  phone. \n Because  one  new  thing  they've  added, \n which  I  think  makes  things  a  lot  easier \n on  this  front,  is  Instaf  frame  mode.  So, \n in  the  past,  you  either  had  to  choose. \n I'm  going  to  shoot  in  360  degrees  so \n that  I  can  pick  what  I'm  going  to  focus \n on  later  and  make  sure  I  don't  miss \n anything.  Or  I'm  going  to  shoot  in \n something  like  follow  me  mode,  which  is \n a  flat  video  that  uses  the  360  vision  to \n constantly  keep  you  in  the  middle  of  the \n shot.  The  X5  though  can  shoot  what \n you're  seeing  right  now,  which  is  both \n types  of  video  at  the  same  time  with \n Instaframe  mode.  It's  just  the  most \n mindless  thing,  having  both  the  ability \n to  tune  everything  afterwards,  but  also \n this  instant  immediately  ready  to  post \n video  at  the  same  time.  That's  one  of \n the  things  that  they've  done  to  make \n things  easier  this  time  around.  It's  not \n the  only  thing.  Like  for  example,  twist \n to  shoot.  While  the  camera  is  on  the \n selfie  stick,  two  little  twists  and  you \n can  start  and  stop  recording  without \n even  having  to  touch  the  thing.  Or  the \n Insta  360  app.  I  always  thought  it  was \n decently  intuitive,  but  it's  now  more \n organized.  The  thumbnails  automatically \n recognize  and  highlight  people,  so  at  a \n glance,  you  can  see  even  clearer  which \n shot  is  which.  And  it's  also  now  just \n way  quicker  to  export  footage  straight \n to  your  phone's  photos  library.  Plus, \n there  is  now  an  Insta3  cloud,  which  can \n free  up  your  SD  card  space  immediately, \n and  also  means  your  friends  and  family \n can  jump  on  and  see  what  you  shot.  All \n finished  off  with  AI  editing  and  AI \n effects  that  just  work  better.  Way \n higher  success  rate  of  seeing  an  idea \n you  like,  clicking  it,  and  then  being \n actually  really  happy  with  how  that  idea \n has  translated  to  your  footage.  But  you \n want  to  know  the  best  bit?  Well,  it \n turns  out  that  it's  not  just  144%  bigger \n image  sensors  helping  out  with  the  image \n quality  this  time  around.  It's  also  that \n this  camera  has  had  massive  increases  in \n computing  power.  Literally  140%  more \n power  thanks  to  a  triple  AI  chip \n configuration.  And  that  has  a  whole  load \n of  side  perks.  Like  for  example,  if  you \n want  to  turn  on  active  HDR  mode,  you  can \n now  do  that  at  60  frames  per  second \n instead  of  30.  Or  just  generally  crisper \n details  and  more  natural  colors  being \n captured  than  the  previous  X4.  But  do \n you  want  to  know  the  single  starkkest \n difference  that  you  get  because  of  this? \n It's  pure  video.  video  that  essentially \n takes  advantage  of  the  full  power \n available  on  this  camera  with  AI  noise \n reduction,  optimized  dynamic  range,  and \n this  basically  erases  what  I'd  consider \n the  final  remaining  concern  that  people \n have  had  with  360  cameras.  Performance \n has  always  been  good  in  the  day,  but \n it's  night  where  you  start  to  notice, \n frankly,  a  spectacular  improvement  in \n noise  and  general  visibility.  So,  long \n and  short  of  it,  this  is  the  best  360 \n camera  on  the  market.  Now,  you  don't \n necessarily  need  one  if  you  already  are \n recording  with  a  high-end  phone,  but  the \n advantages  of  this  become  more  and  more \n clear  compared  to  a  phone  the  more \n adventurous  you're  planning  on  being. \n So,  link  below  to  check  out  the \n Insta360X5.",
