  "transcript": "I'm  about  to  test  products  made  by  the \n most  popular  YouTubers  in  the  world. \n From  creators  with  over  a  million \n subscribers  to  creators  with  well  over \n 50  million,  and  I'm  not  holding  back. \n This  is  about  to  get  brutal.  Last  time  I \n tested  celebrity  made  products,  the \n average  score  was  less  than  five  out  of \n 10.  So,  here's  our  new  rating  board.  Get \n ready  to  lose  some  friends  with  me.  Oh \n yeah,  and  best  product  gets  a  permanent \n place  in  our  hall  of  fame.  So,  let's \n start  with  the  Clicks  smartphone \n keyboard  from  Mr.  Mobile.  This  legend  of \n a  tech  reviewer  with  1.3  million \n subscribers.  Oh,  wo.  On  first  glance, \n this  actually  kind  of  looks  like  a  prank \n gadget.  You  remember  when  the  iPhone  5 \n was  slightly  taller  than  the  iPhone  4? \n And  we  were  all  joking  that  this  is  what \n Apple  was  heading  towards. \n Yeah,  this  is  a  lot.  There's  no  chance \n that  this  is  fitting  into  your  average \n pocket.  If  you  got  women's  jeans,  it's \n over.  I  feel  like  every  time  you  take \n this  thing  out,  it's  going  to  look  like \n one  of  those  magicians  handkerchiefs \n that  just  keeps  going.  Does  wireless \n charging  still  work? \n Technically,  yes,  but  it's  quite  finicky \n now.  And  Mag  Safe  is  even  more  of  a \n scratch.  Like,  technically  works,  but  I \n wouldn't  call  this  Mag  Safe  compatible \n just  cuz  of  how  loose  the  connection  now \n is.  So,  this  had  better  be  a  very  good \n typing  experience. \n Uh,  I'm  not  really  sure  about  this  to  be \n honest.  It  is  very  BlackBerry-esque, \n which  makes  a  lot  of  sense  since  to  make \n this  they  actually  worked  with  one  of \n the  designers  of  the  BlackBerry  Bold. \n But,  and  this  is  just  my  personal \n preference.  All  this  reminds  me  of  is \n why  I  choose  not  to  use  a  BlackBerry \n anymore.  Like,  I  do  think  over  time  you \n could  get  close  to  the  speed  of  a \n virtual  keyboard  typing  on  this,  but \n you're  still  never  going  to  match  it \n just  because  of  the  fact  that  there's  a \n lot  more  resistance  with  a  physical  one. \n Do  you  know  the  thing  that  I  didn't \n factor  in  is  that  the  phone  is  so  heavy \n and  you're  holding  it  with  your  hands \n cramped  down  at  the  bottom  here.  So, \n there  is  so  much  tipping  force  pulling \n it  over.  So,  rating  wise,  I  wouldn't  say \n this  is  garbage.  I  like  that  the  keys \n have  a  built-in  backlight.  I  like  that \n you  can  still  charge  your  phone  while \n using  the  case.  I  like  that  not  having \n to  have  a  virtual  keyboard  can  free  up  a \n lot  of  space  on  your  screen.  There  will \n be  users  out  there  who  love  this  thing \n so  much  that  they'd  be  happy  to  put  up \n with  all  of  the  compromises.  Am  I  one  of \n them?  Probably  not.  Absolutely  love  the \n guy's  videos,  but  the \n product,  it's  not  really  clicking  with \n me.  Four  out  of  10.  This  is  actually  so \n rough.  I  have  to  be  honest  with  these \n ratings,  but  people  are  not  going  to  be \n happy.  Now,  if  you  don't  know  Hank \n Green,  yes  you  do.  He's  one  of  the \n absolutely  OG  YouTubers,  and  he's  got \n his  fingers  in  a  million  different  pies. \n You've  almost  certainly  seen  him  on \n Sihow,  his  Vlog  Brothers  channel,  or \n just  explaining  weird  science  concepts \n on  TikTok.  And  his  product,  it's  going \n to  sound  like  a  joke.  It  actually \n isn't.  So,  this  is  for  people  who  really \n struggle  with  3D  movies.  You  know, \n people  who  get  headaches  just  by  trying \n to  watch  them.  So,  it  converts  them  back \n into  2D  with  none  of  the  blurriness  that \n you  would  get  from  just  taking  your  3D \n glasses  off.  And  I  think  it's  pretty \n clever.  So,  while  3D  glasses  receive  a \n separate  image  to  each  eye,  allowing \n your  brain  to  combine  the  two  images \n into  one  image  that  appears  to  have \n depth,  these  work  by  just  receiving  one \n of  those  images  projected  at  you  by  a  3D \n movie  and  blocking  out  the  other.  Hank \n actually  created  them  all  the  way  back \n in  2010  when  he  wanted  to  go  see  Tron \n Legacy  in  3D  with  his  wife,  who  told  him \n that  she'd  have  to  see  it  in  2D  because \n 3D  gives  her  headaches.  So  unlike  the \n vast  majority  of  people  who  would  have \n taken  this  as  an  opportunity  to  just  go \n and  see  the  film  in  2D,  Hank  decided  to \n instead  create  reverse  3D  glasses  so \n that  they  could  both  go  to  the  3D  movie \n together.  And  you  know  what?  On  our  3D \n TV  from  2014  that  we  spent  a  full  day \n scouting  for  on  Facebook \n Marketplace,  it  actually  works.  3D  movie \n completely  converted  back.  No \n blurriness.  I've  got  mad  respect  for \n this.  He  identified  a  real  problem.  He \n built  a  very  usable  solution.  He  sells \n it  for  just  $10.  Straight  to  an  eight \n out  of  10.  Tough  act  to  follow.  But \n let's  see  if  inventor  Simone  Yetch  with \n 2.8  million  subscribers  can  do  it.  She's \n probably  best  known  for  turning  her \n Tesla  into  a  pickup  truck.  And  I  assume \n she  must  have  got  so  tired  of  people \n looking  at  her  surname  and  pronouncing \n it  Gu  that  when  it  came  to  starting  her \n own  company,  she  decided  to  name  it \n after  the  very  literal  way  that  you \n should  pronounce  that  surname.  And \n honestly,  I  think  this  goal  calendar  is \n the  most  interesting  thing  that  she's \n released  so  far.  originally  made  for  her \n own  purposes  to  help  her  to  meditate \n every  day  for  a  year,  but  she  just  ended \n up  loving  it  so  much  that  she  stuck  it \n on \n Kickstarter.  Oo,  that  was  one  elite  tier \n peel.  I  appreciate  that.  So,  in \n practice,  it's  a  very  simple  product. \n You  decide  the  thing  that  you're  trying \n to  do  more  of  and  then  as  soon  as  you've \n done  that  thing  for  the  day,  you  just \n tap  on  today's  date  and  it  lights  up, \n giving  you  this  bird's  eye  view  of  how \n well  you're  doing  across  the  whole  year. \n And  could  you  imagine  like  how  wildly \n fulfilling  it  would  feel  sitting  there \n on  New  Year's  Day,  tapping  it  for  the \n final  time  and  seeing  every  single  tile \n in  the  year  lit  up.  But  then  again,  at \n the  same  time,  how  infuriating  it  would \n be  to  like  miss  one  random  day  in \n February  and  have  this  permanent  black \n mark  hanging  over  you.  Ultimately,  I \n think  this  is  really  useful.  It's \n essentially  exactly  the  same  thing  as \n the  habit  tracker  that  we've  set  up  in \n our  gym  for  motivation.  Except  unlike \n fiddling  around  with  some  stickers  to \n mark  when  you've  been,  this  uses \n technology  to  make  that  process  even \n more  frictionless.  It  has  adjustable \n levels  of  brightness.  These  are  actually \n 24  karat  goldplated  capacitive  touchpads \n for  some  reason.  And  even  if  you  have  a \n power  cut,  it  actually  saves  your \n progress.  So,  it's  like  pretty  overkill \n for  what's  ultimately  simple \n functionality.  But  if  all  you  want  is \n like  the  best  of  the  best  of  a  habit \n tracker  that  isn't  one  of  the  thousands \n of  phone  apps  you  see  advertised  in \n between  Instagram  reels,  then  I'd  say \n she's  made  it.  And  that's  a  very  cool \n thing  for  a  YouTuber  to  be  able  to  do. \n It  would  be  cooler  if  these  were \n physical  keys  designed  to  be  extra \n satisfying  with  their  own  unique \n rewarding  sound  effects  because  I  got  to \n say  I  do  find  these  touch  plates  a \n little  bit  fiddly  to  use.  But  still,  8 \n out  of  10.  This  is  product  goals.  Star \n Wars  Theory  is  a  channel  that  focuses  on \n Star  Wars.  Here's  the  thing.  If  you \n spent  any  time  on  Star  Wars  YouTube, \n you'll  also  be  familiar  with  the \n insanely  expensive  lightsaber  replicas \n that  are  out  there.  So,  Star  Wars  Theory \n decided  that  they  wanted  to  create  a \n less  obnoxiously  priced  alternative, \n starting  their  own  lightsaber  company, \n Theory  Sabers.  So,  this  is  one  of their \n most  premium  options.  This  is  called  the \n Fallen  Knight.  Wow,  tons  of  stuff  in \n this  box.  This  is  very  clearly  not  a \n rush  job.  So,  this  is  essentially  a \n replica  of  Anakin  Skywalker  saber  with \n its  Kyber  crystal.  you  know,  the  power \n source  of  a  lightsaber  exposed. \n Oh.  Oh, \n wow.  That's  actually  very  impressive. \n Like,  just  listen  for  a  second.  Can  you \n hear  how  it's  reacting  to  not  just  the \n big  movements  I'm  making,  but  even  the \n subtle  sways  with  like  instantaneous \n responsiveness?  There's  actually  two \n kyber  crystals  inside,  red  and  blue,  to \n symbolize  the  conflict  within  Anakin \n between  the  light  side  and  the  dark \n side.  So  many  insanely  niche  touches \n here.  Like,  just  as  a  crazy  example,  you \n see  this  cutout  that  exposes  the \n crystals?  Well,  this  cutout  is  exactly \n the  same  shape  of  the  cut  that  Luke \n Skywalker  makes  in  Vader's  helmet  during \n the  fight  on  Dabar.  Plus,  I  think  this \n is  the  coolest  bit.  So,  we  draw  it. \n Darth  Cidius. \n And  you  can  completely  change  the \n characters  that  it  represents.  It  will \n change  the  saber  color.  It  will  change \n the  sound  effects.  Fit \n check.  Oh,  the  sound  effects  encourage \n experimentation.  I'll  give  it  that.  Ooh. \n Hey,  it's  very  responsive  to  the  impact. \n But  the  only  thing  I  would  say  is  only \n the  middle  of  the  blade  lights  up  even \n if  you  make  contact  at  the \n [Music] \n end.  Oh,  not  again.  I  actually  like \n this.  This  is  a  good  product  for  like  a \n very  specific  kind  of  person.  But  I'm \n doing  a  little  bit  of  digging  on  the \n side  and  it  seems  like  Sabers  isn't \n really  making  their  own  sabers.  They're \n buying  them  from  a  Chinese  company \n called  TXQ.  They're  adding  their  own \n packaging,  their  own  sounds,  but  then \n they're  selling  them  at  like  twice  the \n price,  which  I  mean,  they're  pretty \n great  sounds.  And  the  same  has  also  come \n with  tons  of  custommade  songs \n specifically  baked  into  them.  But  does \n that  not  kind  of  take  away  from  the \n whole  point  of  it  being  a  more \n affordable  alternative  to  something?  And \n what  I  particularly  don't  like  is  that \n it  doesn't  look  like  Theory  is  making  it \n clear  that  they're  doing  this.  Like  so \n many  customer  reviews  on  the  site  are \n from  people  who  think  Theory  is  actually \n manufacturing  these,  which  makes  it \n pretty  clear  that  something  is  being \n lost  in  communication.  So,  theory \n sabers,  five  out  of  10  in \n theory.  But  now  we're  getting  to  the  5 \n million  plus  subscriber  great.  Starting \n with  Jay  Laser  video,  who's  been \n building  real  life  sci-fi  gadgets  on  the \n internet  for  over  12  years  now.  He  did \n this  one  amazing  video  where  he  tried  to \n create  something  as  close  as  possible  to \n Spider-Man's  web  shooters.  And  this  is \n essentially  his  downsized  commercially \n available  version  of  that  shooter \n without  the  risk  of  uh  killing  you.  So, \n it  uses  a  pretty  meaty  spring  in  this \n section  here  to  fire  out  your \n web.  That  is  really  cool.  And  that  can \n either  have  a  magnet  or  a  suction  cup \n attached  to  it.  And  then  a  rechargeable \n motor  at  the  back  to  be  able  to  bring \n that  back  to  you.  So,  let's  say \n Spider-Man's  feeling  a  little \n snackish.  Ooh,  connection.  And  then  we \n pull  it  back. \n Wo!  It  actually  worked.  Let's  say  my \n laptop  is  a  little  bit  too  far  away  for \n me  to  close  myself.  And  now \n pull.  Oh,  nearly.  Okay.  Not  quite  enough \n pulling  force  on  the  motor,  but  if  I \n manually  pull  my  wrist  away,  that \n actually  kind  of  works.  I've  used  a  lot \n of  stuff  like  this  over  the  years. \n That's  pretty  bad.  So,  like  I  was  half \n expecting  the  sticky  pad  to  just \n instantly  bounce  off  the  laptop,  but \n like  success  rate  is  pretty  high.  It's \n still  a  toy,  don't  get  me  wrong.  It's  a \n bit  of  fun.  You  might  add  it  to  a \n cosplay  outfit  to  take  it  to  the  next \n level,  but  it's  a  very  good  toy.  Well,  I \n got  to  say,  YouTubers  are  doing  a  lot \n better  than  I  was  expecting  them \n to.  And  that  brings  us  to  a  product  from \n someone  who's  pretty  massive  in  the  tech \n space.  So,  JerryRig  Everything,  you \n know,  the  tearown  guy  loves  using  razor \n blade  utility  knives.  He  says  they  are \n the  most  versatile  tool  on  the  planet, \n but  he  also  says  that  not  all  of  them \n are  created  equal.  Some  of  them  are  very \n cheap  and  flimsy  and  so  they  have  a  lot \n of  wiggle.  Some  of  them  are  really  big \n and  plasticky.  So  he  basically  decided \n it  was  time  for  him  to  make  his  own. \n Just  a  knife  in  a  box.  No  frrills.  I \n mean,  it  ain't  fancy  packaging,  but  at \n the  same  time,  it's  not  a  fancy  price. \n It's  less  than  $20  normally  and  less \n than  10  when  he  drops  a  sale.  So,  the \n knife  itself,  it  takes  industry  standard \n razor  blades  and  it  comes  with  some, \n which  I  do  appreciate  cuz  I  just  find  it \n so  infuriating  when  products  don't  ship \n with  the  basic  assumed  things  that  you \n need  to  use  them,  like  batteries. \n Anyways,  that's  pretty  good.  Let's  try \n that  again.  Good  old  paper \n test.  Wow.  So,  yeah,  one  thing  you  have \n to  give  this  thing  is  it's  sharp.  We'll \n use  this  for  the  rest  of  our  unboxings \n just  so  you  can  see  how  light  work  it \n makes  of  them.  There's  actually  a  lot  to \n like  here.  It's  got  a  nice  small \n footprint.  I  like  the  fact  that  it's  got \n a  spring  here  which  keeps  the  knife \n fully  closed  or  unfolded.  So,  the  blade \n is  never  sitting  in  this  position  which \n could  become  a  threat  to  life.  I  like \n the  fact  that  even  though  there  is \n plastic  on  the  outsides,  it  doesn't  feel \n plasticky.  And  also,  when  you  open  the \n thing,  I  mean,  it  locks  up  like  a \n freaking  gun  safe  that's  not  moving.  But \n then  at  the  same  time,  this  isn't  like \n some  of  the  products  we've  seen  earlier \n in  this  video.  This  isn't  some  big  new \n innovation  because  the  blades  are \n standardized.  So,  the  blade  here  is \n exactly  the  same  as  the  blade  you'd  use \n on  this  even  cheaper  knife.  The  actual \n product  here  is  really  just  the  handle \n and  it's  pretty  good.  The  only  thing  I \n particularly  don't  like  about  it  is  that \n to  close  up  the  knife,  you  have  to  put  a \n lot  of  pressure  on  this  section  down \n here.  And  the  only  way  that  I  can \n comfortably  do  that  is  to  have  my  other \n fingers  directly  in  the  firing  line  of \n the  blade,  which  just  freaks  me  out.  It \n makes  me  feel  like  I've  got  to  do  this \n whole  maneuver  in  slow  motion  just  so  I \n protect  these  money  makers.  So,  I'm \n going  to  put  this  right  in  between  six \n and  seven.  So,  6.5.  Now,  while  that  tech \n YouTubers  product  is  very  simple,  very \n uncontroversial,  the  Anarch  smartwatch \n is  on  the  complete  opposite  end  of  the \n spectrum.  So,  Tech  Burner  is  a  very \n popular  Indian  tech  YouTuber  and  one  of \n the  very  few  who's  not  just  released \n accessories  of  his  own,  but  his  own \n actual  smart  device.  Feels  good  to \n actually  have  a  sharp  knife  now.  But \n this  smartwatch,  while  initially \n receiving  an  incredibly  strong  reception \n with  Tech  Burner's  announcement  video \n hitting  basically  10  million  views  with \n over  500,000  likes  for  his  immense \n ambition,  then  started  to  get  roasted \n pretty  bad  once  people  actually  got \n their  hands  on  the  thing.  So,  what  do  I \n think?  Well,  I  actually  think  the  design \n is  great.  I  think  it's  really  impressive \n that  as  a  piece  of  hardware,  he's \n actually  managed  to  make  something  that \n feels  distinctive  without  looking  tacky. \n The  straps  feels  premium,  the  casing \n feels  premium.  I  don't  think  that's  a \n small  feat.  And  while  the  software \n doesn't  feel  as  premium,  like  there's  a \n very  quick  demo.  Apple \n Watch  and  now \n anarch.  You  can  tell  the  difference, \n right?  Plus,  it's  looking  very  likely \n that  this  operating  system  is  not \n designed  from  scratch  by  tech  burner. \n It's  a  skinned  version  of  some  existing \n Chinese  software.  You  also  do  have  to \n bear  in  mind  two  things.  A,  that  unlike \n an  Apple  Watch,  this  isn't  $400.  this  is \n like  the  equivalent  of  80.  And  B,  that \n it's  insanely  hard  to  do  this.  It's \n insanely  hard  for  a  YouTuber,  someone \n whose  specialty  is  content  creation,  and \n who  most  likely  will  have  a  very  small \n team  to  actually  design  and  manufacture \n a  tech  product  that's  trying  to  compete \n with  companies  100  times  the  size, \n who've  been  in  the  game  for  a  decade \n plus.  So,  what  I  think  the  vast  majority \n of  this  rests  on  is  does  this  actually \n track  reliably?  Well,  I  have  actually \n been  wearing  this  side  by  side  with  my \n Apple  Watch  for  the  last  few  days.  And \n in  terms  of \n activity, \n honestly,  it  gives  me  nonsense  numbers. \n Like  if  my  elliptical  says  that  my  heart \n rate  is  100,  the  Apple  Watch  will  pretty \n much  always  be  no  more  than  one  or  two \n off  that.  The  anarch  is  very  regularly \n off  by  10  to  15.  That's  not  within \n normal  margin  of  error.  That's  that's \n just  wrong.  And  then  in  terms  of  sleep, \n I  mean,  I  would  say  the  Apple  Watch  is \n not  perfect,  but  at  the  same  time,  it's \n 95%  there.  Like  I  have  cross-  checked \n this  against  a  bunch  of  other  sleep \n measuring  devices  like  smart  beds  and \n sensors  that  go  underneath  your \n mattresses.  And  the  anarch  produced  such \n different  results  to  the  Apple  Watch \n that  honestly  it  just  feels  like  it's \n guessing.  Like  I  know  for  a  fact  this \n day  that  I  woke  up  at  8:00  a.m.  This  is \n telling  me  that  I  was  still  asleep  at \n 8:48  somehow.  And  just  generally  there's \n quite  a  few  things  here  that  could \n easily  be  ironed  out  with  a  Gen  2 \n product,  but  that  persistently  remind \n you  that  this  isn't  one.  Like  the  metal \n here  is  constantly  clanging  against \n things.  The  screen  can  just  blast  out \n light  at  night  when  you  move  your  wrist \n too  much.  So,  while  I  really  really  do \n respect  the  attempt,  I'm  going  to  have \n to \n say  not  this \n time.  But  watch  this  space. \n Now,  if  you  thought  the  J  laser  video \n web  shooter  was  an  impressive  demo  of \n someone  creating  fictional  gadgets  in \n real  life,  then  I  think  the  Hacksmith \n Industries  lightsaber  based  on  the \n consistently  improving  full-size  version \n that  the  guy's  been  working  on  in  his \n videos  for  years  now  has  a  pretty  good \n chance  of  topping  even  that.  So,  the \n packaging  itself  is  designed  to  be  used \n as  a  display  stand.  Oh,  check  this  out. \n I  helped  develop  the  world's  first \n lightsaber.  That  is  great  fan  service. \n And  then  inside  it  all,  here  we  go.  Wow. \n It's  like  proper  full  metal \n construction.  So,  while  these  are  both \n YouTuber  made  lightsabers,  they  go  about \n it  in  completely  opposite  ways.  Theory \n have  gone  for  the  full-size  $600  proper \n replica  display  model  type  route. \n Hacksmith  have  gone  for  miniaturized  $99 \n blow  torch.  All  right. \n Wo!  Oh  my  god.  Holy  cow.  I  mean,  on  the \n full  spectrum  of  how  good  or  bad  I \n thought  this  could  have  been,  this  is \n the  higher  end.  It  definitely  feels  like \n quite  a  bit  more  than  just  a  lighter  in \n a  fancy  body.  Oh  yeah,  and  you  want  to \n know  the  coolest  bit?  You  can  also  put \n these  coloranging  inserts  into  your \n saber  to  change  the  color  of  the  flame \n which  work  by  adding  certain  salt \n crystals  into  the  burn.  So  if  I  stick \n that  onto \n there  and \n then  ah  when  it  catches,  can  you  see \n that  it's  bright \n green?  That  is  actually  so  cool. \n Especially  because  of  how  similar  that \n is  to  how  a  lightsaber's  kyber  crystal \n is  meant  to  determine  the  color  of  the \n blade.  And  let's  see  what  kind  of  power \n we're  working  with. \n Wa \n woo.  The  speed  that  that  thing \n collapsed.  It's  actually  a  pretty \n serious  piece  of  equipment.  So,  what \n would  I  actually  use  this  for  in  my \n day-to-day  life?  Honestly,  probably  like \n lighting  candles  and  that's  about  it. \n Would  I  keep  buying  these  color  change \n inserts?  Probably  not.  They're  like  $14 \n for  a  pack  of  12  and  they  last  about  2 \n minutes.  But  is  this  a  really  unique \n product  that's  very  cool,  delivers  on \n exactly  what  it  sets  out  to  without  any \n major  real  compromises?  Hell  yeah.  I  am \n going  to  award  it  our  first  9  out  of  10. \n With  almost  16  million  subscribers  now, \n it's  airact  time.  And  I  just  want  to  say \n seeing  this  either  this  guy  is  like  a \n master  of  marketing  or  he  has  very \n literally  reinvented  cuisine  because  his \n product  a  source  that  in  his  words  turns \n anything  into  pizza  is  about  as \n tantalizing  of  a  prospect  as  it \n gets.  So  I  actually  got  sent  this  one \n from  Ara  himself.  I  told  him  we  were \n making  this  video  and  he  basically  just \n replied  say  no  more.  And  then  this  box \n showed  up.  So  this  is  his  pizza  sauce \n and  then  I  guess  stuff  to  use  it  with. \n Wait,  dried  pineapple  chunks.  Oh,  I \n suppose  because  pineapple  pizza \n Pringles.  What's \n this?  Just  a  box  of  insects.  Oh  my  god. \n So,  here's  what  I  think  is  the  use  case \n for  this.  You're  really  craving  a  pizza, \n but  at  the  same  time,  you  can't  be \n bothered  to  actually  go  to  the  kitchen \n and  hand  make  one  yourself  for  20 \n minutes.  So,  how  close  does  it \n get?  So,  we're  going  to  assume  that  real \n pizza  is  a  10.  So,  now  pizza  fry  on \n toast.  This  feels  like  such  a  stretch. \n I  actually  really  like  it.  It's  very \n rich,  indulgent  sauce  that  does  a  very \n good  job  converting  this  into  tasting \n like  pizza  without  being  so  much  that \n you  can't  eat  it  in  large  quantities \n like  a  lot  of  sauces.  I'd  say  that's \n like  85%  on  the  way  to  being  pizza. \n Right,  let's  try  a  pineapple \n chunk.  That's  the  weirdest  combination \n of  foods  I've  ever  eaten.  The  link  to \n pizza  is  starting  to  become  a  little \n tenuous.  I'd  say  that's  50%  as  good  as \n pizza.  And  finally,  let's  try  on \n something  that's  distinctly  not  tasty. \n So,  pizza  foy  on \n cauliflower.  Yeah,  I  feel  like  at  that \n point  it  starts  to  just  taste  like  salty \n seasoning.  So,  if  I'm  being  really \n honest,  do  I  think  this  is  very  clever \n and  also  slightly  misleading  marketing? \n Yeah,  because  if  you  boil  it  down, \n really,  this  is  basically  marinara  sauce \n with  a  slight  cheesy  taste  that  I'm \n assuming  is  coming  from  the  inactive \n yeast  inside.  Then  I  kind  of  feel  like, \n you  know,  when  you  click  on  a  really \n clickbait  YouTube  thumbnail,  but  then \n the  video  itself  ends  up  being  so  good \n that  you're  almost  grateful  for  that \n thumbnail  for  getting  you  to  click. \n Because  is  this  still  good  marinara \n sauce?  I  would  say  yes.  The  only  real \n thing  is  the  price.  It's  $25  for  two \n bottles.  So,  it's  not  quite  an  eight.  I \n will  give  you  a  saucy  7.  I  feel  like  I \n don't  even  need  to  introduce  Lionus  Tech \n Tips,  one  of  the  very  original  tech \n YouTubers  and  an  inspiration  to  many  of \n the  ones  who  followed.  And  Lionus  has \n released  a  ton  of  products  in  his  time. \n But  if  you  were  to  ask  what  is  the \n single  most  impactful  one,  I  think  most \n people  would  tell  you  the  screwdriver. \n LT  set  out  to  basically  make  the  best \n screwdriver  humanly  possible.  It  took \n them  3  years  and  hundreds  of  thousands \n of  dollars  to  get  to  this.  Now,  whether \n or  not  it  was  worth  it,  we'll  get  to. \n Uh,  what  I  do  like  straight  off  the  bat \n is  I  think  this  is  how  a  YouTuber  should \n make  a  product.  Lionus  effectively \n decided  that  he  loved  the  screwdriver \n from  a  company  called  MegaPro  because  of \n its  ability  to  store  the  bits  inside  of \n the  handle.  And  so  instead  of  pinching \n the  idea  or  trying  to  copy  it,  he \n approached  the  company  to  try  and  work \n with  them  on  it.  And  then  instead  of \n just  taking  the  good  product  they'd \n already  made  and  just  slapping  his  label \n on  it,  he  tweaked  basically  everything \n about  it  in  ways  that  he  felt  would  make \n it  even  better.  So,  I  kind  of  feel  like \n it  utilizes  his  expertise  as  a  reviewer \n and  gets  around  the  fact  that  he  doesn't \n have  a  background  in  manufacturing.  So, \n anyway,  the  handle  is  very  meaty  and \n also  very  grippy.  It  feels  like  even  if \n you  do  get  a  little  sweaty  screwing \n things,  you're  still  going  to  be  able  to \n keep  going.  These  bits,  they  also  fit \n really  securely  in  on  the  inside.  Like, \n they  are  not  going  anywhere.  And  then \n there's  a  pretty  strong  magnet  at  the \n tip  to  hold  those  bits  in  place,  which \n has  the  other  benefit  of  also  being  able \n to  catch  screws  as  you're  taking  them \n out.  Not  to  mention  the  uh  naturally \n occurring  haptics  here \n are  yeah  I  mean  that's  just  pristine.  I \n think  this  is  like  elite  tier  YouTuber \n product  and  not  necessarily  because \n they've  worked  harder  than  others.  It's \n because  I  think  they've  worked  smarter. \n Like  working  with  a  company  who  makes \n screwdrivers  day  in  day  out  means  that \n you  no  longer  have  to  worry  about  all \n the  little  niggles  that  can  crop  up \n making  your  own  product.  So  all  Lionus' \n team  needed  to  do  here  is  the  finetuning \n and  making  it  even  better.  9.5  out  of \n 10.  Right.  Joyide  Candy  is  probably  the \n least  techy  thing  in  this  entire  video, \n but  I  just  think  it's  so  naturally \n interesting  because  the  face  of  the \n brand  is  now  Ryan  Tran,  the  YouTuber \n fast  approaching  20  million  subs.  Cuz \n here's  the  thing,  I  love  Ryan  Tran.  We \n even  did  a  video  together.  It  was  very \n fun.  But  I  also  have  to  admit,  I'm  very \n health  consscious.  And  so  my  Spidey \n senses  immediately  perk  up  whenever \n someone  says  that  something  is  healthy \n when  it  doesn't  look  or  taste  it.  And \n this  is  pretty  clearly  candy  that's \n being  marketed  as  being  healthy.  They \n say  no  fake  colors.  They  say  no  junk \n ingredients.  It  literally  on  the  bag  it \n says  4  g  of  sugar,  no  junk.  Okay,  I'm \n going  to  go  watermelon  wedges.  This  is \n what  I'd  pick  if  I  saw  them  all  on  a \n store  shelf.  Okay,  first  impression, \n it's  a  little  sticky.  Feels  wet.  I \n wouldn't  exactly  call  it  big  flavor  like \n it  says  on  the  packet  here.  It's \n actually  pretty  small  flavor.  I  wouldn't \n say  it's  incredibly  sweet.  I  wouldn't \n say  it  has  that  kind  of  sharp  tanginess \n of  like  a  Haribo,  but  that's  not \n necessarily  a  complaint.  Like  I \n generally  prefer  more  neutral  flavors. \n So  this  is  exactly  the  kind  of  thing  I \n would  naturally  gravitate  towards \n anyway.  So  the  flavor  is  pretty  good. \n Then  the  question  becomes  how  have  they \n made  that  flavor  pretty  good?  Because  if \n it  is  just  4  g  of  sugar  and  then  a \n bucketload  of  aspartame  sweetener  then \n what's  the  point  right?  So  the  two  key \n sources  of  sweetness  in  this  apart  from \n sugar  are  alulose  and  stevia  which  I \n mean  as  far  as  the  current  medical \n understanding  of  these  two  is  concerned \n they  are  both  naturally  occurring  low \n and  zerocalorie  sweeteners  that  don't \n spike  your  blood  glucose.  I  actually \n went  on  a  really  strict  diet  a  couple  of \n years  ago  where  the  only  source  of \n sweetness  I  could  have  was  stevia  and  I \n was  sick  of  it  because  the  aftertaste  is \n horrible  which  is  probably  why  they've \n combined  it  with  alolo  and  sugar.  Okay, \n so  my  review  is  I  really  like  the \n product.  I  just  think  they  need  one \n tweak.  I  think  instead  of  writing  no \n junk  on  the  front  cuz  if  we're  being \n really  honest,  this  is  still  an \n ultrarocessed  candy  packed  full  of \n sweeteners  and  no  junk  definitely \n implies  it's  healthy.  It  really  should \n change  to  less  junk.  that  would  make  it \n clear  that  it's  healthier  than  a  lot  of \n its  competitors  because  I  think  it's \n pretty  fair  to  say  that  it  is,  but  also \n that  it's  not  healthy  compared  to  say  a \n piece  of  fruit.  And  then  you  factor  in \n cost.  This  is  like  I  actually  haven't \n seen  a  candy  more  expensive  than  this. \n It's  like  $5  a  bag.  So  in \n totality,  Joyide  gets  a  6.5  out  of  10. \n Do  I  have  to?  Oh,  this  is  going  to  be  so \n bad.  Too  much \n pizza.  They're  great  products  on  their \n own.  to  put  them  together.  Now,  I \n probably  don't  need  to  tell  you  that \n Marquez  Brownley,  MKBHD,  launched  a \n wallpaper  app  at  the  end  of  2024  because \n the  backlash  from  it  ended  up  spiraling \n into  something  far  bigger  than  even  the \n original  announcement.  People  questioned \n the  price,  a  $50  per  year  subscription \n for  wallpapers.  People  questioned  the \n privacy  of  their  data  with  the  app \n asking  for  a  lot  more  permissions  than \n you'd  expect  for  a  JPEG  downloader.  And \n then  just  the  general  question  of  who \n even  asked  for  a  wallpaper  app  in  2024. \n So,  now  that  all  that's  died  down,  now \n that  the  app's  had  some  updates,  what  I \n want  to  do  is  to  download  it  and  see  if \n it's  actually  good.  So,  booting  it  up \n for  the  very  first  time,  there  are  still \n permissions,  but  this  now  does  look  like \n the  base  minimum  that  you  would  need  for \n an  app  that  has  adverts  and  that  needs \n to  be  able  to  save  stuff  onto  your \n device.  So,  then  it  asks  you  to  pick \n five  artists  that  you  like.  So  far,  I \n mean,  pretty  good  experience.  Wallpaper \n apps  generally  have,  ironically,  some  of \n the  worst  user  interfaces.  This  is \n pretty  nicely  organized  and  animated. \n And  at  this  point,  you  are  basically \n just  in  a  feed.  Every  now  and  again, \n you'll  see  a  collection  that  you  have  to \n pay  for.  And  I  have  to  say,  some  of  them \n are  very  expensive.  Like  this  one  is \n four  fairly  similar  looking  digital \n images  for  $7.99.  But  at  the  very  least, \n those  collections  are  optional.  And  at \n least  the  money  is  being  split  with  the \n artists.  So,  let's  say  that  I  like  the \n look  of  this  wallpaper  that's  not  part \n of  a  collection.  So  I  click  it,  get \n wallpaper  and  then  h  so  it's  either \n download  it  in  1080p  which  let's  be \n honest  on  any  high-end  modern  smartphone \n is  not  a  very  good  option  because  most \n of  them  have  displays  that  are  higher \n resolution  than  that  and  many  of  them \n will  also  end  up  stretching  that \n wallpaper  in  the  process  of  applying  it. \n And  so  then  if  I  want  the  high-res  I \n have  two  options.  I  either  subscribe  to \n the  app  which  to  be  fair  does  now  cost \n less  than  it  used  to.  It's  either  $2  a \n month  to  get  all  the  standard \n wallpapers,  which  feels  reasonableish, \n or  it's  $12  a  month  or  50  per  year  to \n also  include  the  collections,  too.  50  a \n year  feels  understandable.  12  a  month \n feels  like  too  much.  Or  the  final  option \n to  get  your  full  res  wallpaper  is  you \n click  here.  Wow,  that's  over  30  seconds \n of  full  screen  ad.  Okay,  so  clearly  this \n isn't  perfect.  This  isn't  some  miracle \n app  that  instantly  gives  you  all  the \n best  wallpapers  for  free.  But  I  do  think \n the  interface  is  slick.  I  think  the \n average  wallpaper  quality  is  pretty \n high.  And  the  most  important  thing  is  it \n doesn't  feel  like  I'm  getting  hustled. \n You  know,  there's  so  many  free  apps \n which  will  display  one  of  these  full \n screen  ads  every  time  you  click  the  back \n button,  whereas  it  doesn't  feel  like \n they're  trying  to  hide  what  this  is.  So, \n I  would  give  panels  a  solid  six.  He's \n clearly  listened  to  feedback  and  he's \n tried  to  improve  it.  If  you're  of  a \n certain  age,  you've  definitely  seen  a \n Vsauce  video.  And  if  not,  you've \n probably  at least  seen  people  do \n impressions  of,  \"Hey,  Vsauce,  Michael \n here.\"  So,  in  the  same  vein  as  the \n mind-bogglingly  niche  science  think \n piece  videos  that  they've  always  made, \n the  Vsauce  Curiosity  Box  is  an \n educational  science  toy  subscription \n with  video  lessons  and  instructions  from \n Michael  himself  on  how  to  use  the \n things.  So,  straight  away,  first \n impression  is  I  can  see  why  this  is  fun. \n There's  a  whole  bunch  of  quite  varied \n looking  stuff  inside  of  it,  all  with  its \n own  unique  presentation.  And  at  the  very \n bottom,  a  t-shirt,  too.  So,  the  obvious \n risk  with  stuff  like  this  is,  is  it \n actually  fun  for  more  than  like  an  hour? \n and  does  it  provide  any  other  value \n after  that?  Okay,  so  MGS1  which  is  Mars \n global \n simulant.  So  simulated  Mars  soil  used  by \n NASA  to  test  equipment  that  would  be \n deployed  on  Mars.  So  this  is  what  Mars \n feels  like.  It's  all  right.  Don't  know \n why  Musk  is  in  such  a  rush  to  get  there. \n What  do  I  do  with  it  now?  Okay,  so  67 \n shadow  alphabet  shapes.  So  you  got  to \n use  these  to  create  kind  of  like  the \n negative  space  around  each  letter \n without  creating  the  letter  itself.  It's \n interesting.  It's  just  not  necessarily \n particularly  different  from  picking  up  a \n jigsaw  puzzle.  So  then  we've  got  picture \n pie,  which  is  essentially  a  bunch  of \n stencil  discs  that  allow  you  to  draw  a \n picture  by  consistently  drawing  tiny \n separate  lines  and  then  rotating  the \n disc.  It'll  feel  like  nonsense  while \n you're  doing  it,  only  for  you  to  then \n take  the  disc  off  at  the  end  to  reveal  a \n pretty  coherent  looking  result.  Oh,  and \n of  course,  even  the  t-shirt  is  not \n normal.  This  is  an  amphiroll  knot \n depicting  the  only  known  15  crossing \n knot  where  both  the  knot  and  its  mirror \n image  are  the  same.  Should  have  been  a \n V-neck.  There's  even  like  a  book  here \n called  Why  Not.  Get  it?  Like  not  because \n it  teaches  you  about  60  different  knots, \n how  to  make  them,  and  includes  the  rope \n you  need  to  do.  So,  all  of  this  stuff  is \n like  incredibly  complex  and  super  nerdy, \n but  I  can  see  why  people  are  into  it.  I \n like  what  this  stands  for.  I  like  the \n fact  that  this  stuff  very  literally \n encourages  curiosity.  It  makes  you  think \n a  little  outside  the  box  and  that's  like \n food  for  your  brain.  But  then  at  the \n same  time,  it  is  like  $60  a  box.  And \n largely  speaking,  most  of  this  stuff \n isn't  teaching  you  skills  that  are \n particularly  relevant  or  translatable. \n It's  very  much  like  here's  some  wacky \n things  to  do  that  are  a  bit  different  to \n the  usual  Lego.  So,  I  like  it.  I  just \n don't  love  it.  I  think  some  of  this \n stuff  could  quite  easily  end  up  as \n clutter.  7  out  of  10.  Unbox  therapy. \n unboxer  therapier  and  bender  of  the \n iPhone  6  back  in  the  day.  This  guy  in \n 2019,  he  claimed  that  he's  never  found  a \n phone  case  that  he  actually  likes. \n They're  all  too  bulky  or  too  flimsy. \n They  collect  dust  and  dirt,  and  he \n struggled  to  find  good  ones  for  the  more \n niche  devices.  So,  he  decided  to  create \n his  own  case  company  that  quote  wouldn't \n ruin  your  smartphone.  And  one  of the  key \n ways  that  they  apparently  do  that  is  by \n being  made  of  premium  Kevlar  aramid \n fibers  that  allow  them  to  be  very  strong \n while  being  impossibly  thin.  So,  right \n off  the  bat,  these  guys  were  not  kidding \n with  the  thinness.  The  thing  feels  like \n a  sheet  of  paper.  And  when  you  put  it \n on,  my  phone  actually  does  feel \n completely  different  to  how  it  feels \n with  a  thick  case.  I  love  this  matte \n texture.  You  can  actually  feel  the \n weave.  And  it  is  also,  to  their  credit, \n incredibly  easy  to  slip  on  and  off. \n That's  one  of  the  key  pain  points  they \n said  they  wanted  to  fix,  and  I  can \n confirm  that  they  have.  So,  is  this \n goated?  Well,  not  immediately,  because \n for  starters,  I  mean,  how  often  do  you \n need  to  take  your  case  off?  I  don't \n think  I've  done  it  in  about  3  months.  I \n don't  think  this  later  case  looks  the \n best.  It's  very  gappy  around  the  sides \n and  it  makes  the  cameras  resemble  a \n fidget  spinner.  Plus,  because  it's  so \n thin,  it  doesn't  have  any  magnets  in \n either.  So,  your  Mag  Safe  is  a  lot \n weaker  than  it  is  on  something  like \n this.  Okay,  scratch  test  time.  Let's \n just  try  something  very  soft,  like  a \n level  four.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, \n no.  Okay, \n well,  might  as  well  finish  my  sentence \n now.  So,  not  very  scratch  resistant  at \n all.  Okay,  time  to  drop  test.  And  I'm \n not  doing  this  to  go  higher  and  higher \n and  see  which  one  of  these  breaks  first \n because  looking  at  the  size  of  this \n case,  the  answer  is  pretty  obvious.  It's \n more  a  question  of  if  you  drop  a  phone \n with  this  case  from  a  normal  height  that \n most  people  might,  will  it  survive?  So, \n 3  2 \n [Music] \n 1.  Not  great  noises.  So  my  main  phone \n with  my  main  case  are  completely  fine \n with  some  very  very  light  marking  where \n the  case  has  hit  the  floor.  The  later \n case  has  importantly  completely \n protected  the  phone,  but  the  case  itself \n has  suffered  a  little  bit  more  casualty. \n So  it  does  serve  the  base  function  of \n protecting  your  phone  in  a  form  factor \n that's  not  too  bulky  and  that  has  this \n really  nice  comfortable  matte  texture. \n But  then  some  part  of  me  is  also  looking \n at  this  thinking,  what  does  this  do  at \n $60,  by  the  way,  which  is  just  insane \n for  what  this  feels  like  that  a  $10  or \n $15  case  doesn't  do.  Not  much,  I  would \n say.  So,  Later  Case  gets  a  five  out  of \n 10.  Could  have  been  a  greater  case.  At \n well  over  60  million  subscribers  now, \n it's  Mark  Grober,  the  exNASA  engineer \n who  now  spends  his  time  making  insanely \n large  scale  science  engineering \n concepts.  And  he's  also  created  Crunch \n Labs,  which  is  yet  another  subscription \n box,  but  this  time  it's  more  focused  on \n giving  you  one  buildable  project  that \n teaches  you  STEM  concepts.  Oh,  yeah.  So, \n here  is  where  I  spent  45  minutes  trying \n to  peel  off  the  address  label  with \n limited  success.  And  then  inside,  please \n don't  be  a  glitter  bomb.  Please  don't  be \n a  glitter \n bomb.  Okay.  So,  unlike  the  Vsauce \n Curiosity  box,  this  box  is  just  one \n thing  and  everything  inside  is  focused \n on  making  that  one  thing.  So,  the  box  we \n got  is  for  the  disc  launcher,  which \n Joseph  on  our  team  happily  put  together. \n He  said  it  was  fun  and  it  only  took  13 \n minutes  total,  which  is  not  a  terrible \n thing.  There's  two  types  of  boxes  you \n can  get.  The  build  box,  which  is  more \n for  kids  and  is  the  one  we  have  here, \n and  then  the  hack  pack,  which  is  made \n for  teens  and  adults  and  would  take \n closer  to  an  hour.  So,  turn  it  on \n here.  And \n then, \n wow.  I  got  to  say,  the  accuracy  is \n phenomenal.  They've  managed  to  retain \n this  really  authentic  homemade  feel  to \n these  projects,  but  at  the  same  time \n while  having  the  kind  of  performance \n that  you'd  expect  from  something \n pre-made.  It's  still  not  going  to  occupy \n you  for  days  on  end,  but  this  has  felt \n like  one  of  those  experiences  in  which \n every  single  part  of  the  process  has \n been  very  well  thought  through. \n Everything  from  the  website  design  I \n thought  was  so  sick  to  the  instructions \n where  it  really  does  fully  explain  the \n reason  why  it  works  the  way  it  works  to \n the  fact  that  for  every  box,  Mark  Robber \n has  made  a  separate  dedicated  video  just \n to  give  you  even  more  insight.  Plus, \n unlike  the  Vsauce  box,  this  is  $25, \n which  yeah,  I  mean,  you  get  less  stuff, \n but  I'd  rather  have  just  one  thing  I \n love  as  opposed  to  six  things  I  kind  of \n like.  So,  based  on  this  box  and  on  my \n experience,  I  think  this  is  deserving  of \n a  9  out  of  10,  which  means \n congratulations,  Lionus.  Highest  rated \n product  from  the  entire  video.  Welcome \n to  the  Hall  of \n Fame.  But  there's  one  thing  that  gets \n promoted  by  YouTubers  more  than  anything \n we've  seen  so  far.  VPNs  like  ExpressVPN, \n but  also  our  sponsor,  Surf  Shark.  So,  I \n just  wanted  to  very  clearly  show  you  why \n Surf  Shark  is  just  the  straight  up \n better  product.  So,  firstly,  pop  onto \n their  websites.  ExpressVPN  starts  at  $5 \n a  month.  Surf  Shark  starts  at  $2  a  month \n with  four  extra  months  for  free  if  you \n use  the  code  boss  at  checkout.  But  what \n about  the  speeds?  Well,  this  phone  is \n using  Surf  Shark.  This  phone  is  using \n ExpressVPN.  And  both  are  connected  to \n Morocco.  Okay.  Well,  Surf  Shark  is \n coming  out  significantly  faster.  But  I \n mean,  even  if  it  was  the  same,  it \n doesn't  make  any  sense  to  me.  Like,  the \n only  thing  I  can  see  that  ExpressVPN  has \n is  105  servers  compared  to  Surf  Shark's \n 100.  But  if  your  actual  speed  is  slower, \n then  why  does  that  even  matter?  All \n topped  off  with  the  fact  that  Surf  Shark \n has  unlimited  users  for  that  one \n subscription  price  compared  to  eight \n with  Express  and  just  antivirus,  data \n breach  alerts,  and  even  an  alternate  ID \n feature  for  you  to  use.  So,  head  to \n surfark.com/boss  to  check  it  out  for \n yourself.",
