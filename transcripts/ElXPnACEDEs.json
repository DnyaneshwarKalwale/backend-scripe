  "transcript": "it  so  Sid  men  are  going  to  get  us \n underway  enjoy  guys  here  we  go  real  life \n he  going  to  go  for  the  shot  no  way  a  I \n don't  mind  it  but  Out  Swinging  corner \n here  from  Simon  in  the  mixer  oh  loog \n ball  goes  there  is  a  clearance  off  the \n line  Bingo  asking  for  a  hand  ball  it  was \n Jing  that  stopped  it  was  there  a  hand \n involved  Joe  well  Joe  well  was  very \n close  to  scoring  there  let's  take  a  look \n at  this  well  a  lovely  little  finish  oh \n should  be  get  off  he  should  be  obviously \n have  a  his  and  they  going  to  V  which \n isn't  really  a  thing  here  I  think  clber \n has  just  looked  at  the  screen  and  given \n it  retrospectively  I  don't  mind  it  right \n penalty  and  it  looks  like  be  Joe  W  it \n takes  it  after  he  won  it  to  go  one  n  up \n will  never  in  doubt  and  he  gives  it  a \n two  and  it's  not  his  first  time  scoring \n a  we  by  the  way  he  scored  in  the  first \n ever  Wembley  cup  10  years  ago  and  I've \n Just  Seen  A  suplex  on  him  he's  been \n suplexed  by  Logan  ball  what  are  we \n seeing  it's  a  crossover  WWE  and  football \n one  of  YouTube's  good  guys  as  well  I \n might  been  a  foul  throw  there  but  we'll \n let  him  off  it  who's  the  bad  guys  no \n comment  Chris  that's  a  dangerous  one \n wasteful  Chris  Ginge  now  he  a  marauding \n center  half  does  he  fancy  a  long  ball \n for  Nik  he  does  oh  that's  a  CRA  excuse \n he's  got  a  decision  to  make  he  stay \n speed  making \n the  he's  going  to  give  it  it's  another \n penalty  he's  going  to  give  it  it's \n another  penalty  Niko's  won  it  Harry's \n giving  it  away  he's  saying  it's  all  bull \n ref  now  will  curg  look  at  the  monitors \n once  again  in  the  crowd  here  and \n potentially  overall  himself  I  I  think \n Harry  took  the  man  and  got  the  ball  but \n just  have  a  look  it  was  it  was  Reckless \n Niko  penalty  he  didn't  even  touch  the \n ball  clattenburg  you  got  it  right  there \n son  fair \n play  yeah  Harry  Harry  that's  outrageous \n that  you're  saying  you  got  the  ball \n there  my  son  Mr  Beast  on  pens  yeah  okay \n let's  have  a  look  oh  saved  and  that \n could  be  a  decision  the  all  stars  live \n to \n regret  good  save  from  xqc  by  the  way  xqc \n he's  a  big  star  on  the  net  and  now  he's \n a  star  in  one  free  kick  though  Chris  and \n D  he  he  claims  to  be  better  at  free \n kicks  than  most  premier  league \n footballers  put  your  money  where  your \n mouth  is  and  you  of  it  listen  You'  got  a \n goalkeeper  who  has  just  saved  a  penalty \n short  but  is  not  the  most  practiced  of \n goalkeepers  Get  It  On  Target  Chris  you \n got  a  chance  here  this  is  it  Christopher \n M \n D  he  always  delivers  Christopher  MD  get \n the  sh  get  this  on  your  hinge \n profile  that's  iconic  that  is  Iconic \n drink  it \n in  Chris  m  d  the  magic  man  he  always  can \n Chris  there  eyeing  up  the  women  in  the \n crowd  what  a \n pig  okay  what  you  got  Chris  he's  looked \n for  it  at  the  back  stick  and  it's  in  who \n else  but  Theo  Baker  he  knows  how  to \n score  he's  Fair  than  he's  ever  been  and \n he's  back  I  mean  there  will  be  patches \n of  his  hair  on  the  ball  but  it  was  a \n cracking  head  of  Spencer \n I  mean  that  is  a  tale  of  older's  time \n Chris  MD  to  Theo  Baker  stin  in  culture \n YouTube  history  the  ball  was  a \n tantalizing  one  the  header  was  exactly \n what  he  needed  just  guided  past  the \n keeper  where's  the  defense  the  who's  man \n marking  him  and  he's  found  speed  speed \n got  with  him  we  got  a  few  people  offside \n in  the  mix  but  he's  Lo  and  he  could  have \n had  a  touch  but  it's  it  anyway  it's \n another  goal  it's  Lan  as  put  it  away  go \n and  that  is  Football  let's  go  it  is  The \n Wizard  of  Oz  with  a  wicked  goal  one  for \n the  theater  fans \n there  I  don't  think  it's  going  to  be  an \n easy  day  look  at  this  I  was  about  to  say \n they're  not  going  to  have  it  too  easy \n with  Ginge  and  fos  at  the  back  like \n they're  just  consumate  Defenders  will  KN \n not  so  much  to  even  it  up  a  little  bit \n take  the  pass  e  keep  it  moving  mini  Mina \n can  he  get  him  back  in  the  swing  of \n things  here  gets  the  shot  off  there  you \n go  it's  what  he  does \n cut  him  open  and  he  bleeds \n [Applause] \n goals  Simon \n Men  He  bangs  it  home  it's  the \n celebration  there  in  honor  of  his \n expected  child  you  love  to  see  it  as's  a \n baby  on  the  way  well  he  knows  how  to \n find  the  target  he's  proved \n that  we  have  a  game  on  our  hands  three \n two  Danny  aens  gets  the  ball  from  Ginge \n looking  at  his \n options  he  could  use  a  bit  more  whip  out \n there  a  bit \n more  opportunities  for  jinge  I  think \n going  direct  look  it's  like  a  Flying  V \n here  they're  all  off  apart  from  Theo  is \n not  bursting  through \n Baker  he  might  be  a  baker  but  he's \n cooking  he  really  is  and  this  time  he's \n not  set  in  the  corner  of  a  hotel \n room  it's  uh  it's  almost  too  easy  I \n think  people  are  expecting  the  flag  to \n go  up  on  speed  clear  maker  Blaze  to  the \n whistle  Toby's  going  to  take  this  corner \n on  outside  of  the  bo  looking \n for \n Simon  great  safety  sketch  he's  done  it \n again  very  impressed  by  both  goalkeepers \n so  far  we've  got  about  eight  Subs  ready \n to  come  on  for  the  all  stars  by  the  way \n lined  up  there  a  forward  ball  to  Josh \n great  touch  from  derker  through  ball  it \n might  not  be  a  goal  but  it  could  be  in \n the  oh  sketch  again  sketch  is  up  there \n with  my  foot  mod  man  of  the  match  right \n now  lovely  touch  from  Simon  Weller  left \n foot  how  he  likes  it  oh  it's  in  it's  the \n curse  of  the  commentator  but  it's  a \n second  goal  for  Joseph \n Weller  he  scored  again  gets  them  closer \n to  equalizing  but  here's  Manny  Josh  make \n your  run  Josh  make  your  run  take  theend \n away  he's  on  side  play  to  J  this  is  it \n Josh  no  oh  my  God  stany  aens  nearly  I've \n got  it  anyway  this  is  a  joke  you  can't \n take  your  eyes  off  it  ddy  aens  near \n scored  one  of  the  most  ridiculous  own \n goals  of  all  Team  all  time  and  then  Toby \n follows  up  with  that  Toby  or  not  Toby \n well  it  is  to  be  today  for  all  and \n Joella  he's  on  a  h  trick  could  it  be  now \n Corner  comes  in  headed  by  Logan  Paul \n Rober  at  the  back  stick  sticks  it  back \n in  the  mixer  J  gets  up  needs  a  keeper \n it's  Logan  Paul  with  the  goal  no  one  saw \n that  coming  WWE  Superstar  boxer  and  now \n soccer  goal \n scorer  the  man  is  in  his \n prime  deji  overrunning  it  though  gives \n it  to  Manny  Manny  looking  at  the  back \n post  for  Weller  he's  on  a  hattick  here \n can  he  make  it  three  got  to  me  give  it \n to  Josh  give  to  Josh  surley  clattenburg \n wants  a  word  with  fosch  Josh  you've  got \n to  take  this  hang  on  what's  going  on \n here  there  we  go  there  you  go  there  your \n clip  they  shredded  it  we  have  fun \n outrageous  from  F  take  your  time  pick \n your  spot  and  make  history  what  he  got \n his  locker  apart  from  boiled  sweet  and \n Viagra  Josh \n yes  there  you  have  it  pigs  can  fly  do \n not  adjust  your  television  set  do  not \n refresh  your  browsers  they  said  it \n couldn't  be  done  when  it's  been  done  and \n it  can't  be \n undone  this  side  men  complete  the \n collection  and  Josh  gets  his  goal  look \n at  what  it  means  to  them  both  managers \n celebrating  everyone \n delighted  I  don't  think  there's  a  dry \n eye  in  the  house  well  done  Joshua \n lurer  got  to  be  a  goal  squ  really  s  side \n that'd  be  a  goal \n Ginge \n oh  very  generous  of \n Ginge  yeah  clar  is  the  the  man  I  tell \n you  of  his  life  I'm  not  even  sure  that \n was  going  in  speed's  going  to  take  it \n we've  just  had  Josh  break  his  duck  and \n score  a  goal  we  could  see  speed  to  do \n the  same  thing  surely  he  scores  this  he \n missed  last  year  against  EXC  could  this \n be  his  moment \n here  we  go  the  former  mayor  of \n Peru  Darren  AKA  speed  he \n in  he's  done  it  and  they're  all  on  the \n pitch  they  think  it's  all \n over  Miss  wow  seen  absolute  scen \n 65  it  didn't  come  quickly  but  speed \n finally  gets  his  goal  and  look  what  it \n means  to  him \n he's  done  it  it's  reminiscent  of  P \n winning  the  World  Cup  for  Brazil  and \n being  lifted  by  his \n peers  Chris  and  D  on  I  don't  know \n anymore  oh  Clark's  overrun  it  giving  it \n the  chunks  Jing  is  off  the  speed  is  and \n leave  it  Jing  was  off  100  this  is  your \n moment  ging  he  scored  there  you  go  but \n that  was  offside  and  if  he  left  it  for \n Speed  he  wouldn't  have  been  and  he  might \n go  back  and  change  it  but  let's  just \n pretend  we  can  see  it  jinge  gets  the \n goal  the  decision  to  put  him  up  front \n looks  to  be  Vindicated  lovely  finish  six \n to  P  the  postman  delivers  even  on  a \n weekend  questions  will  be  asked  back \n underway  here  through  board  from  the \n throw  is  beautiful  Simon  in  big  oh  off \n scramble  and  by  the  way  willan  has  just \n thrown  himself  at  the  ball  in  an  act  of \n Bravery  it's  too  much  CH  a  moment  of  M \n on  the  ball  surely \n scores  that  is  what  you  call  ghost \n goalkeeping  it's  gone  absolutely  through \n him  like  the  curry  I  had  last \n week  chunks  with  another  goal  I  believe \n that's  three  in  three  for  the  big  man  he \n knows  where  the  back  of  the  net  is  here \n he  is  the  baker  looking  for  Speed  in  the \n Box  what  a  ball  speed  hit \n it  oh  he  still  got  it \n oh  that  puts  in  the  roof  of  the  net  and \n speed  might  not  be  the  most  prolific \n finisher  but  he  can  provide  like  nobody \n else  what  a  move  from  the \n Americans  over  to  Weller  got  quite  a \n deep  starting  position  here  we  know  what \n he  can  do  in  the  BX  will  need  like  a \n baby  giraffe  he  wants  to  beat  him  again \n here  he's  done  it  again  twice  can  you \n make  it \n three  great  touch  Manny  what  a  safe \n sketch  what's  going  on  there  Toby \n against  Theo  pass  him  oh  yeah \n Manny  Manny \n finish \n get  game  on \n 87  good  goal  for  Manny  once  again  we're \n seeing  the  brothers  link  up  it's \n beautiful  to  see  come  Manny \n here  we \n go  Jin's  trying  to  apply  some  pressure \n to  Ethan  and  he's  off  get  it  to  Manny \n Manny  like  a  bll  with \n gas  he's  got  his  brother  to  the  right \n finds  Toby  could  there  be  a  chance  here \n Toby  plays  it  into  Simon  can  he  pull  it \n back  this  could  be \n Ean  it's  happened  again  and  it's  a  oh \n and  where  we  see  a  knee \n slide  there  it  is  right  on  Q  come  on  you \n irons  come  on  you \n Bazinga  s  men  have  played  their  way  back \n into  this  game  JJ  plays  it  back  not  sure \n what  he  was  thinking  there  yeah  excuse \n see  you  just  get  rid  of  it  mate  jeez \n Lise  JJ  oh  JJ  got  to  be  a  goal  for  Speed \n surely  there  was  the  pass  on  oh  what  a \n save  wow  that  is  unreal  from  excus  he \n might  broken  his  wrist  but  my  God  was  it \n worth  it  get  his  rating  up  to  a \n five  it  works  for  him  he's  a \n unit  can  he  get  this  cleared  j's  got  no \n oh  no  I  take  it  back  National  League \n North  at  best  he's  just  kicked  it \n basically  in  his  own  net  I  think  Clark's \n finished  it  but  Jing  you  doing  so  well \n son  you  might  have  just  cross  the  team \n the  game  that  here  comes  Chris  and  D \n great  part  of  if  anyone  could  score  is \n this  man  for  a \n hattick  Jeff  H  he  famously  scored  a \n hatrick  of  Wembley  to  win  the  World  Cup \n well  Theo  Baker  can  join  that  list  a \n hatrick \n ofle  I'll  tell  you  what  he's  got  one \n hand  on  the  Golden  Boot  and  he's  just \n kept  his  team  in  the  game  it's  penalty \n Spencer  never  before  have  we  seen  a \n penalty  shoot  out  but  this  man  who's \n stepping  forward  has  had  that  feeling \n time  and  time  again  Simon \n Minter  huge  moment  for  him  he's  had  a \n great  game  he's  still  the  highest  rated \n on  foot  mob  by  believe  he  knows  what \n he's  doing  from \n here  surely  he  scores  there's  no  way \n sketch  saves  a  penalty  from  Simon \n there's  no  way  this  is  the  banker  it's \n just  which  corner  he's  putting  it  in \n Stick  It  On  Target  it  goes \n in  Simon  no  way  I  can't  believe  it's  for \n but  what  just  happened  what  a  save  SK \n this  is  what  I'm  talking  about  it's  a \n chance  to  be  heroes  look  at  the  smile  on \n that  young  man's  face  what's  up  brother \n and  the  YouTube  Allstars  can't  believe \n it  what  a  moment  for  sketch  no  one  saw \n that  coming  what  a  save  that  is  it's \n actually  Sensational  from  the \n lad  that's  the  NFL  experience  coming \n through  there  it  is  Ling  in  the  safety \n no  TouchDown  for  you  and  deji  steps \n forward  deji \n seriously  Dei  please  score  this  mate \n where's  the  goggles  now  son  left  footed \n I  didn't  even  know  he  was  left  footed \n de  yeah  do  that  will  do  he  puts  it  away \n beautifully  that's  the  first  10,000 \n unlocked  from  Prime  there  of  course  it \n is  sticking  on  the  totalizer \n I  never  knew  he  was  left  footed  I  don't \n think  anyone's  ever  seen  him  kick  a  ball \n before  that's  why  he's  played  him  pretty \n much  every  game  but  I've  never  seen  him \n kick  a  ball  he  show  Simon  how's  it  done \n how  it's  done  even  so  the  YouTube \n Allstar  are  in  the  lead  and  now  it's \n over  to  Mark  robber  who  needs  to \n engineer  away  to  get  siden  back  in  this \n game \n 44  years  young  some  would  say  that  makes \n him  old  I  say  that  makes  him \n experienced  Mark  Rober  against  sketch  as \n he  got  a  like  an \n engine  Rob  lovely  sends  the  keeper  the \n wrong  way  well  done \n you  great  finish  from  Mark \n there  and  he  keeps  the  siden  in  the  game \n as  Theo  Baker  steps  up  it's  another  10K \n from  Prime  as  well  thank  you  very \n much  sketch  in  one  of  the  moment  of  the \n game  denied  mini  min  and  denied  10,000 \n to  charity  thanks  a  lot  sketch \n has  already  got  a  hattick  I  think  he's \n my  man  of  the  match  especially  with  you \n consider  the  Redemption  Arc  the  only \n thing  that  could  spoil  it  be  if  you \n missed  the  penalty  now  I  just  can't  see \n it  happening  Theo  yeah  that's  what  you \n got  to  do  LZ  that's  what  you  got  to  do \n water  is  wet  and  Theo  Baker  scores  and \n is  also  wet  probably  after  scoring  AR  we \n all  and  10,000  Chuck  it  on  CH \n Ching  Here  Comes  30k  so  far  we  raising \n the  Sho  howed  up  next  this  man  can  hit \n them  oh  he  can  especially  when  there's  a \n lot  on  the  line  he  needs  to  score  to  be \n fair  not  mathematically  but  a  miss  here \n would  put  the  siden  in  a  difficult \n position  he's  got  highlights  in  his  hair \n now  can  he  get  a  highlight  in  this  game \n surely  sketch  can't  save  another  one \n Harry \n OHL  it  sneaks  in  that  been  a  ridiculous \n save  from  sketch  I  mean  the  the  nerves \n going  through  the  San  boys  must  be \n through  the  roof  look  at  sketch  getting \n to  these  penalties  he's  committing \n himself  wholeheartedly  and  I  love  it  but \n it  goes  in  and  now  the  next  YouTube \n Allstar  stepping  up  Chris  MD  now  he  has \n missed  the  penalty  one  of  these  games \n before  first  ever  game  at  Southampton \n denied  by  Hugh  whizzy  but  the  it's  a \n team  of \n Bankers  Chris  and  does  not  miss  xqc  you \n need  to  match  what  sketch  did  against \n Simons  time  for  a  save  the  only  thing  he \n misses  is  of  course  his  ex  Chris  there \n you  go  solid  as  a \n rock  he  is  a  big  goona  and  not  just \n because  she  left  him  it's  another  10K \n and  doing  the  uh  the  meditation \n celebration  there  is \n he  and  he  was  calm  and  composed  there \n Joe  Weller  bowling  up  to  the  spot  now \n scored  a  penalty  already  in  the  game  two \n in  the  match  in  total  now  I  can  tell  you \n Spencer  he's  going  to  hit  it  to  his \n right  keepers \n left  but  I'm  not  sure  sketch  will  have \n much  to  do  about  it  it's  a  long  run  up \n well  get  in  very  similar  to  his  one  in \n the  game  just  a  well  hit  P  yeah  you're \n not  going  to  get  to \n those  he  loves  it  loving  life  there  well \n up  it's  a  big  goal  for  the  siden  they \n needed  it  now  if  the  All  Stars  score \n this  siden  have  to  score  their  last  P \n who's  been  given  it  it's  nicana  he \n really  should  have  scored  in  the  game \n speed  he  should \n but  was  he  saving  it  for  this \n moment  xqc  over  to  you  to  make  this  a \n very  interesting \n finale  six  goals  already  in  the  shootout \n 60,000  from \n Prime  Niko  om  here \n Lana  oh  he's  just  done  enough  he's  done \n enough  and  now  we  have  essentially  a \n sudden  death  scenario  now  s  men  has  to \n score  all  stars  have  to  miss  or  it's \n over \n and  who's  the  man  to  keep  them  in  the \n game  JJ  it's  the  main  man  the  captain  of \n this  ship  let's  face  a  team  effort  of \n the  side  man  but  this  man  started  it  he \n basically  started  the  UK  YouTube  scene \n and  now  you  got  the  whole  world  watching \n my  son  you've  got  to  score  or  your  team \n lose  I  mean  if  he  doesn't  score \n contractually  we're  not  allowed  to  speak \n about  his  misses  so \n sketch  has  got  different  ideas  though \n it's  JJ  versus  sketch  JJ  has  to  score  or \n the  sidan \n lose  not  like  this  slow  run  up  we  didn't \n need  this  not  like  this  come  on  JJ  put \n it  away  now  D  well \n done  he's  in  the  thick  of  it  I'll  tell \n you  what  Spencer  I  was  convinced  chunks \n was  going  to  be  on  this  last \n penalty  it's  speed  no  you  I  really  am \n not  sure  if  that's  a  wise  decision  the \n finishing  in  that  game  from  speed  was \n tant  m  to \n treason  if  he  scores  he  wins \n it  will  he  be \n denied  xqc  this  is  your  moment  forget \n everything  I  don't  know  many  goals  you \n can  see  across  the  last  two  games  I \n think  it's  about  15  odd  but  forget  about \n that  save  this  one  speed  to  win  it  for \n YouTube  Allstars  make  him  put  it  either \n side  stand  down  the  middle  excuse  see  be \n the  biggest  Sue  you've  ever  heard  if \n this  goes \n in  here  we  go \n speed \n no  it  wasn't  one  for  a  beauty  contest \n but  it  gets  in  over  the  line  there's  the \n back  flip  and  it's  a  YouTube  All  Stars \n win  on  the  biggest  day  inside  men \n history  theyve  spoiled  the \n party  excc  so  close  to  Glory  there  but \n there's  no  shame  in \n that  look  at  it  there  you  go  sketch  lift \n that  trophy  with  pride  my  son  lift  it  up \n and  smashed  it  when  it  mattered  he  came \n through  wow  look  at  the  scenes \n here  and  the  YouTube  All  Stars  are  your \n side  men  charity  match \n 2025  Champions  and  they  did  it  on  the \n big  occasion  Wembley  Stadium  tacked  out",
