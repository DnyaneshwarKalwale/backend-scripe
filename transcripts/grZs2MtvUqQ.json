  "transcript": "My  relationship  with  Michael  is  all \n content.  Every  single  bit  of  it  is  fake. \n Like  we've  been  going  strong  for  almost \n a  fake  ring.  Tell  him  to  bring  it  out. \n We're  planning  a  wedding  arc  soon.  So  if \n I  cheated  on  my  pregnant  wife,  I  would \n not  be  saying  that  on  IG  stories.  I  tell \n Michael  like,  \"Sorry  honey,  I'm  PMSing.\" \n He's  like,  \"Oh,  I  know.\" \n Hi  guys,  welcome  to  episode  39.  As  you \n guys  may  have  noticed,  something  is \n different  about  today.  And  that  is  it's \n true.  My  glasses  are  20%  bigger.  See? \n Really?  Yeah.  I  got  huge  frames.  Oh  my \n god.  I  could  not.  You  can't.  No.  It's \n Wait,  you  look  so  much  more  like  that \n thing  we  always  compare  you  to.  The  one \n No,  not  behind  you.  Do  you  have  one  over \n there?  Loopy.  It's  called  Loopy. \n One  of  those.  Yeah,  I  think  those.  We \n can  put  the  image  side  by  side  to  Lily. \n You're  you're  kind  of  merging  into  the \n same  thing.  I  might.  Yeah,  I  love  to \n see.  I've  always  wanted  big  giant \n frames.  I  finally  fulfilled  my  goals. \n They're  so  cute.  Anyway,  besides  that, \n oh,  I  guess  we  got  like  new  lighting  or \n something.  It's  so  good,  isn't  it? \n Please,  please  tell  us  what  you  think. \n This  is  the  final.  Like,  this  is  end \n game,  right?  Cuz  I  don't  want  to  change \n any  more  things.  To  be  honest,  I've \n never  seen  like  I've  I've  never  had \n lighting  done  this  professionally  and \n this  well,  and  it  shocks  me.  It's \n beautiful.  I'm  like,  \"Oh  my  god,  this  is \n what  a  a  professional  does,  an  expert  in \n their  field.\"  I  think  before  too,  the \n lighting  was  a  little  like  harsh  on  my \n eyes  sometimes.  But  this  is  warm.  It's \n comfortable.  It's  like  being  enveloped \n in  like  your  mother's  bosom  in  a  nice \n silk  blanket.  I  was  going  to  compare  it \n more  to  having  multiple  little  suns  in \n the  room,  but  also  on  a  semi  cloudy  day. \n like  a  really  hot  anime  girl  hugging  you \n and  her  face  is  nestled  against  her \n giant  boobs  like  warm.  I  mean,  I  don't \n know  what  that  has  to  do  with  lighting, \n but  I  guess  from  a  warmth  perspective, \n you're  actually  pretty  spot  on.  Yeah, \n it's  like  warm.  I  like  it.  I  feel  agree. \n And  I  do  have  to  call  out  the  incredible \n contrast  between  my  side  and  yours.  It \n reminds  me  of  the  very  first  episode  we \n did,  but  higher  level,  I  guess.  [ __ ]  the \n audio  only  listeners,  huh?  Guys.  Oh,  I'm \n so  sorry,  Lily.  That's  your  job. \n Lighting  good.  Lighting  real  good.  I \n know  you  want  to  go  check  out  the \n YouTube  video  if  you  want,  but  no \n pressure.  I  know  you  do.  Anyway, \n anyways,  welcome  back.  How  are  you \n doing?  I  missed  you.  I  feel  like  I \n haven't  seen  you  in  so  long,  but  I  know, \n but  I'm  sure  we  saw  we  saw  each  other. \n Literally  a  week.  But  even  today,  I \n think  we're  splitting  up  after  this.  I \n haven't  had  enough  vitamin.  Vitamin  L \n sounds  terrible.  That  makes  you  sound \n bad.  Oh,  it's  me.  Like,  what  the  [ __ ]  is \n vitamin \n L?  That  was  so  confusing.  Oh,  that's  me. \n Vitamin  and  L.  Um,  but  yeah,  I  feel  like \n hasn't  been  enough  Lily  Pokey  time,  but \n there  will  be  more.  Maybe  even  this \n week.  I'm  trying  to  convince  her  to  do \n the  shake  it  to  the  max  dance.  Lily's  in \n her  Tik  Tok  dancer  era,  which  I  actually \n love  and  I  think  is  so  cute.  And  she \n wants  me  to  do  the  shake  it  to  the  max. \n [Laughter] \n She  wants  me  to  do  that  dance  with  her, \n which  honestly,  literally  just  yesterday \n I  was  looking  at  it  and  I  was  like, \n that's  a  very  you  dance.  I  kind  of  want \n to  learn.  Oh,  thank  Wait,  what  does  that \n mean?  Like  I  think  it  just  like  it  would \n fit  you  very  well.  Like  you  would  look \n really  hot  and  sexy  doing  it.  Oh,  thank \n you  so  much.  I  think  it  would be  really \n cool.  But  there  are  certain  dances  you \n think  I  wouldn't  look  sex  like  I \n wouldn't  I  can't  imagine  you  doing  like \n a  actually  no  I  can  imagine  you  doing \n sorry  I'm  sorry \n I  love  training  her  to  I'm  a  good  girl \n anyway  yeah  so  she's  on  a  Tik  Tok  dancer \n era  and  please  tell  us  how  that  came  to \n be  well  remember  the  K-pop  video  that \n offline  TV  did  you  guys  filmed  that  like \n a  minute  ago  that  was  December  and  I  I \n remember  doing  the  dance  lesson  and  I \n was  like  I  was  having  so  much  [ __ ] \n fun,  right?  And  I  I  said  this  already, \n but  like  dancing  to  me  is  like  playing \n piano  and  fighting  games.  It's  the  same \n thing  over  and  over  again  till  you \n perfect  something.  Anyway,  after  I  took \n a  break,  so  I'm  like,  \"Oh,  I  can't  find \n any  classes.\"  Blah,  blah,  blah.  And  then \n I'm  like,  you  know,  maybe  I'll  just  try \n learning  on  my  own.  I  asked  Ara  to  teach \n me  like  a  dance  outside.  I  love  when  Ara \n teaches  and  then  I'm  like,  oh,  it's  so \n fun.  And  then  it's  like,  oh  my  god,  I \n want  to  learn  like  more  cuz  like  cuz \n it's  like  like  um  what's  the  word? \n satisfying  when  you  practice  something \n and  then  your  body  like  does  it.  I  feel \n like  as  gamers  we  can  kind  of  just  gify \n anything.  Like  I  feel  that  way  about  the \n gym  sometimes.  I'm  like,  \"Okay,  I'm  hip \n thrusting  this  much.  Next  week  I  want  to \n hip  thrust  that  10  lbs  more.\"  It's  like \n improvement.  It's  like  a  little  high \n score.  But  dancing  is  just  really  fun \n though  cuz  you  can  like  It's  like  an  art \n form  too,  right?  Yeah.  And  there's  the \n fun  social  media  reward  of  posting  it. \n But  she  sent  me  this  video.  I  was  like, \n \"Oh,  yeah.  Um,  I'd  love  to  do  that  dance \n with  you.  I  just  need  to  learn  it.\"  And \n she  goes,  \"I  have  the  best  tutorial  for \n you.\"  Oh  my  god,  this  guy  is  so  funny. \n She  sends  me  this  dude.  Is  he  Indian? \n I'm  actually  I  don't  know.  He's  Indian. \n I  think  it's  an  Indian  dude  on  YouTube, \n which  mind  you,  they  make  the  best \n YouTube  tutorials.  If  you  know,  you \n know. \n For  starters, \n for  starters,  he  is  singing  the  audio \n track  the  whole \n copyrighted  which  is  so  funny  and  also \n because  he  puts  huge  text  on  the  screen \n going,  \"Sorry  for  my  singing.  I  don't \n want  to  get  copyrighted.\" \n It's  like  things  that  are  just  so \n unintentionally  funny.  I  know.  which  is \n also  so  like  it's  so  earnest  because \n you're  like  yeah  you  know  what  I  do  want \n him  to  get  that  AdSense  teach  I  worked \n hard  to  teach  this  tutorial  instructions \n are  so  funny  and  he's  like  put  your \n hands  up  the  cops  are  after  you  and  then \n when  you  start  shaking  your  hips  he's \n like  why  are  you  shaking  your  hips  cuz  a \n bug  fell  down  your  pants  he  just  he \n likes  it  he  just  compares  things  to  such \n silly  stuff  cute  and  charming  I  left  a \n comment  actually  and  he's  lighthearted \n it  looks  really  Thank  you.  He  noticed \n you.  He  noticed  me.  And  you're  sharing \n his  videos.  Yeah.  You're  a  good \n community  member.  Thank  you.  Thank  you. \n Damn,  that's  crazy.  I  wonder  if  we  have \n any  good  community  members.  All  of  them. \n All  of  them  are  little  buds.  So  cute.  I \n feel  like  we  kind  of  gave  up  on  the \n nicknames  a  little bit.  We  kind  of \n should  go  back  to  Well,  I  like  the \n butts.  Best  buds.  Little  buds.  I  think \n taste  buds.  Best.  So  cute.  They're  very \n cute.  Yeah.  All  right,  let's  get  into \n recent  news.  cuz  I  went  to  Head  in  the \n Clouds.  Okay.  It  was  so  fun.  Really?  And \n listen,  I  don't  like  festivals.  I'm \n ready  to  say  don't  like  festivals.  Don't \n like  concerts.  Don't  hate  them.  Don't \n hate  anybody  that  goes  to  them  or  likes \n them.  Bless  your  heart  genuinely.  But \n me,  I  just  get  overstimulated  really \n easily. \n One,  two,  ever  since  the  pandemic,  I \n think  crowds  scare  me.  I  just  think  of \n disease. \n And  three,  crowds  equal  disease.  And  I \n wish  I  need  to  uncondition  my  brain  to \n be  honest.  And  three,  for  some  reason,  I \n think  I'd  be  just  as  content  watching  a \n live  concert  from  home.  Like,  woo, \n music,  we  have  concert. \n Ah,  four,  I  don't  really  like  drinking \n or  drugs,  so  I'm  also  I'm  usually  the \n sober  one,  which  is  not  very  fun.  And \n sometimes,  I  don't  know  how  else  to  say \n this,  but  there  are  some \n things  that  you  need  to  be  drunk  or  high \n for,  you  know,  and  if  you're  not  either, \n like,  it's  just  not  your  Do  you  get  what \n I'm  saying?  Oh,  not  me.  No,  I  love \n drinking  and  drugs  and  everything  about \n it.  So,  I'm  just  completely  opposite.  I \n hate  being  sober.  Okay,  but  you \n Okay,  but  you  get  how  some  festivals \n you're  like,  damn, \n bro.  Like,  I  can  see  some \n drunk  as  hell.  That  would  be  fun.  But \n when  you're  sober,  there's  just  a \n different  feeling.  I  have  been  sober, \n but  then  being  around  other  like  really \n drunk.  Yeah.  Once  I  was  around  other \n drunk  people  or  just  high,  I  don't  know \n what  they  were,  but  they  were  having  a \n grand  old  time.  And  I  feel  like  I  got \n like  compact  drunk.  Hi.  I  actually  so \n know  what  you  mean.  I  just  like  the \n vibes.  I'm  like,  I  like  this.  You  know \n what  else  is  really  similar?  when  you \n just  stay  up  too  late \n and  you  get  this  like  overt  tired \n feeling  and  then  you're  borderline \n drunk.  You're  crying  of  laughter.  You \n don't  know  what's  going  on.  You're \n saying  silly  things.  At least  for  me. \n No,  I  get  that  fatigue.  Anyway,  so  yeah, \n I'm  not  big  on  festivals,  but  Head  in \n the  Clouds  was  actually  so  nice  cuz  it \n was  spacious. \n There  were  lots  of  different  sections \n kind  of  at  uh  kind  of  similar  to  maybe \n like  a  Coachella.  Yeah,  but  all  the \n sections  had  significant  amount  of  room. \n Of  course,  I  also  in  a  way,  maybe  I'm \n biased,  I  got  I  got  some  pretty  nice \n treatment.  Um,  but  it's  also  nice.  So \n many  friends  were  there,  so  many  nice \n people.  I  felt  like  the  crowd  was  really \n chill  and  all  the  artists  there  are  so \n sweet.  So,  it  really  felt  like  my  kind \n of  festival.  I  think  I  will  be  back.  Can \n you  come  with  me  next  year?  Isn't  Wasn't \n this  the  last  Head  in  the  clouds  ever? \n What?  That's  what  Broden  said. \n It's  the  10th  anniversary.  I  don't  know \n about  last.  Really?  Why  was  I  told  it \n was  the  last  ever?  I  was  going  to  say \n that's  so  random. \n No,  you  know,  he  sounded  serious. \n Someone  sounded  serious.  I  forgot  who \n said  it. \n Fake  news.  I  don't  think  it's  the  last \n one.  I'll  be  at  the  next  one.  Wait,  I \n need  to  know.  And  Lily  will  too.  It \n looks  like  it  might  be  the  last  one.  I \n told  you.  Why?  It  just  says  there's  no \n concert  dates  for  the  Head  and  the  Cloud \n scheduled  in  2026. \n Well,  maybe  just  because  the  last  one \n just  happened.  No,  they  said  it  was  like \n um  I  I  don't  remember  exactly  the \n reason,  but  you  know what?  Let's  just \n fact  check  me  later.  Well,  let's  just \n say  if  there's  a  next  one,  we'll  be  at \n the  next  one.  Sure.  You'll  invite  me  as \n an  artist.  I'll  perform. \n Wait,  you  know  they  probably  would. \n Don't  say  that.  Yeah,  I'll  do  it  in  the \n clouds.  Yeah,  if  unfortunately  it's  the \n last  one.  So,  there's  not  going  to  even \n be  one  in  2026.  But  if  there  were  one  to \n all  the  listeners  and  viewers  out  there \n right  now,  I  can  do  it.  I  cannot  wait  to \n make  this  happen.  It's  the  last  one.  I'm \n I'm  sorry  to  tell  you  it's  the  last  one. \n I  love  almost  like  a  challenge.  No,  I \n know.  Even  if  it  was  the  last  one,  I \n would  literally  make  another  one  happen \n just  so  you  perform  there.  That's \n cringe.  Don't  do  that.  You  don't  got  to \n do  that.  Anyways,  Head  and  Clouds  was \n super  fun.  Got  to  meet  some  of  the \n artists.  Got  to  meet  some  of  y'all. \n Great  time.  I  don't  even  have  much  to \n say.  It  was  just  good.  You  just  had  a \n good  time.  I  wish  it  lasted  longer. \n Crazy.  Um,  and  then  it  says  Lily  Dash \n grand  piano.  I  bought  a  grand  piano. \n Really?  Baby  grand  piano.  Where?  It's  in \n the  living  room.  In  your  Oh,  I  didn't  go \n to  the  living  room.  That's  right.  So,  we \n got  a  We  got  mail.  Like  mail?  Mail?  Like \n IRL  physical  mail  that  came  in.  Oh,  I \n thought  you  I  thought  it  was  like  a  man. \n No,  we  got  one  of  those.  We  got  man. \n said  which  one?  Okay,  we  got  mail  and  it \n was  like,  oh,  we're  selling  some  old \n pianos  and  new  pianos  at  the  school. \n Like  the  music  department  is  getting  rid \n of  some  things,  but  they  also  have  like \n new  blah  blah  blah.  And  Daniel's  like, \n \"You  want  to  go?\"  And  I'm  like, \"Okay, \n [ __ ]  it.  Let's  just  check  it  out, \n right?\"  And  I  just  did  win  $30,000  from \n Lewig's  GM  tournament.  So,  you  know, \n that  has  to  be  taxed,  honey.  Uh \n oh.  Also,  I  didn't  even  get  paid  yet,  so \n I'm  spending  money  I  didn't  get  yet. \n Anyway,  I  go  there.  I'm  like,  \"Ooh, \n nice.  This  is  nice.\"  I  touch  one  and  I'm \n like,  \"This  one  this  one's  nice.\" \n Kawaii,  nice  brand.  I  go  to  the  white \n one  and  I'm  like,  \"This  one's  really \n nice,  too.\"  Oh,  more  expensive  because \n it's  it's  white.  Okay.  And  then  I  go  to \n like  all  the  Stein  Steinway  whatever, \n which  is  like  60  70k  and  I'm  like,  I'm \n not  going  to  touch  that  one \n anymore.  And  then  I'm  just  like,  you \n know,  playing  all  these  pianos  and  I \n found  one  that  I  really  like.  Sound  is \n really  pretty.  It's  very  velvety.  Plays \n nice.  And  I'm  like,  \"Okay,  maybe  I'll \n just  yolo  buy  it,  right?\"  Because  I've \n always  wanted  a  grand  piano,  but  it's \n baby  grand,  but  same  [ __ ]  for  me.  Yeah. \n And  we  just  ended  up  buying  it  then  and \n there.  Saleswoman  was  like  there  and \n she's  like,  \"You  just  want  to  buy?\"  I'm \n like, \"Yeah,  okay.\"  And  we  signed \n everything  and  they  delivered  it  like  2 \n days  later.  So  it  to  be  How  much  was  it? \n $20,000. \n It's  like  a \n People  liken  it  to  Okay.  the  myth  that \n grand  pianos  are  an  investment  or  they \n appreciate.  They  don't.  They're  like \n cars.  It's  quite  the  opposite.  They  do \n not  appreciate.  That's  kind  of  what  I'd \n assume  of  any  instrument  actually.  It's \n like  the  maintenance.  No,  but  some \n instruments  I  think  the  older  like  vi  I \n know  really  old  violins  that  are  worth \n like  they  sound  better,  but  they're \n worth  millions.  Oh,  he  wants  pets. \n Um,  are  they  worth  more  because  they're \n older?  I  have  no  clue.  But  the  sound  is \n rare,  too.  I  don't  know.  With  piano,  it \n doesn't  work  that  way.  It's  like  a  a \n car.  You  do  got  to  like  maintain  it.  You \n do  got  to  make  sure  it  looks  like  on  its \n shape,  you  know?  You're  getting  it \n because  you  like  piano  and  you  want  to \n play  piano,  which  is  why  I  got  it.  Yeah. \n You  said  they  kind  of  sound  different. \n How  so?  Um,  different  grands  for  sure \n sound  different.  Oh  my  god.  Binkies \n having  the  time  of  his  life  on  Poké \n Slap.  To  be  fair,  I  would  be  having  the \n time  of  my  life  on  Poké.  That's  such  a \n lie  because  I  tell  her  to  sit  on  my  lap \n all  the  time  and  then  she  acts  shy. \n Keyword  acts  cuz  she's  not.  She's  not \n shy.  I  just  I  just  feel  so  bad  like  if \n my  you  know  big  ass  is  on  your  honestly \n valid  but  I  need  you  to  understand  I \n consent.  Okay.  I  just  I'm  just  a  little \n shy,  you  know.  Don't  be.  You  don't  know \n the  scope  of  how  big  it  is.  So  I've  been \n over  a  few  times.  I'm  learning  the \n scope.  Anyway,  you  know what's  big \n though?  my  grand  piano,  you  know,  it's \n bigger  somehow.  It's  um  it's  nice.  So, \n I'm  happy.  I'm  happy  with  it.  I'll \n probably  do  more  music  content.  Say \n wants  to  come  over  tomorrow  and  do  just \n music  with  Eugene  and  stuff.  I'm  like, \n \"Oh  my  god,  let's  do  it.  [ __ ]  it.\"  He \n plays  um  guitar  and  violin  apparently. \n So,  I  mean,  yeah, \n he  Sonic  episode.  Yeah.  So,  I'm  excited \n music  jam  sessions  again.  I'm  excited \n for  it.  You  should  stream  some  of  them. \n I  I  I  want  to  ask,  but  I'm  shy.  Oh  my \n god.  You  should  start  a  stream  segment \n where  you  do  music  jam  sessions,  but  you \n also  invite  people  who  don't  know \n anything.  Okay,  so  imag  let  me  paint  a \n picture.  You're  on  the  piano. \n Okay,  Eugene  is  on  the  violin. \n Whatever  a  violin  sounds  like.  Okay,  me \n trombone  big.  But  I'm  on  tempo.  I'm  on \n tempo,  guys. \n And  we're  just  jamming  together.  Kind  of \n like,  you  know  those  videos,  those \n YouTube  videos  you  put  up. \n [Music] \n I'm  gonna  give  you  a  little  Coke  can  and \n you  can  go  bunk  bunk  bunk.  That's  what  I \n was  trying  to  say.  The  triangle,  but  I \n said  the  trombone.  My  bad.  But  yeah,  I \n was  like  wondering  trombone.  The \n trombone's  the  big  one,  right?  Anyways, \n that  goes  to  show  how  little  I  know.  I \n see.  What  other  simple  instruments  could \n I  play?  I  think  you  could  do  like  drum. \n Maybe  you  could  learn  like  just  one \n rhythm.  The  drums  are  hard.  No,  like  one \n like  just  one  just  one  drum  and  you're \n just  like  fake. \n I'm  going  to  look  like  a  monkey.  That \n would  be  cute.  Thank  you.  Thank  you  so \n much.  You  monkey  me.  Thank  you.  Okay, \n travel  plans.  You  know,  we're  going \n through  the  update  segment.  Okay,  travel \n plans.  We  were  Okay,  I'm  trying  to \n convince  Lily.  Go  to  China  with  me.  Are \n you  going  to  come? \n I  want  to.  I'm  already  going  with \n someone  else.  So,  if  you  don't  come,  my \n friendship  with  them  is  going  to  improve \n and  ours  is  going  to  deteriorate.  How \n does  that  make  you  feel?  Well,  it  just \n depends  the  time.  July.  July.  July  is \n doable.  Let's  go.  But  you  and  I  am  not \n available.  Yeah,  me  neither.  Okay.  Yeah. \n July  might.  Yeah,  that  Okay,  we'll  talk \n about  it  later.  We  were  actually  going \n to  go  to  Japan,  but  that  was  last  month. \n Wait,  May.  Wait,  this  month?  Yeah,  this \n month.  Oh,  it  would  have  been.  We  were \n gonna  go  to  Japan  this  month,  but  it \n fell  through.  Fell  through.  Okay,  I  have \n some  Tik  Tok  tea  for  you.  All  right. \n This  week's  Tik  Tok  tea  is  crazy.  I  know \n all  the  girls  are  nodding.  Right.  Right. \n Are  you  ready?  I'm  ready.  This  one's  a \n doozy.  For  starters,  do  you  know  who  the \n wizard  Liz  is?  No.  Yeah.  Let  me  show  you \n a  photo  just  in  case  you  recognize  her. \n Yeah.  Oh,  you  do?  No.  No.  Like,  yeah,  I \n don't  know  her.  Damn.  Okay.  Well,  she  is \n a  very,  very,  very  popular  content \n creator,  especially  amongst  the  female \n demographic  online.  She  talks  a  lot \n about  self-confidence,  how  to  be  your \n best  self,  how  to  glow  up,  how  to  get \n over  breakups,  like  really  just  female \n empowerment.  I  really  like  her  content. \n I  like  her  videos.  She's  so  fun  to \n listen  to.  And  from  a  personal \n perspective,  I  really  connected  with \n her,  not  just  cuz  she's  a  content \n creator,  but  because  she's  also  Middle \n Eastern.  And \n so,  not  too  long  ago,  about  7  months \n ago,  she  posted  a  video  talking  about \n how  she  got  engaged.  Congratulations.  I \n know.  Let  me  also  clarify  some  things. \n She's  very  outspoken  about  um  wanting  a \n guy  who  can  spoil  her. \n I  know.  And  um  you  know how  you \n shouldn't  be  with  a  guy  who  can't \n provide.  Actually,  she  has  expressed \n this  in  some  kind  of  funny  ways.  She's \n like,  \"Some  people  call  me  a  gold  digger \n or  things  that  I  want  or  the  standards \n that  I \n have.  Is  it  so  bad  that  I  don't  want  a \n man  who's  financially  responsible  and  is \n going  to  give  my  children  financial \n trauma  and  then  they're  going  to  grow  up \n having  to  and  she'll  just  like  go  off  on \n it?\"  But  anyways,  it's  kind  of  that \n vibe,  you  know  what  I  mean?  Yeah.  Yeah. \n Yeah.  So,  she  announced  her  engagement, \n which  was  so  cute  and  exciting,  and  she \n started  making  content  with  this  guy \n that  she  was  engaged  to.  And \n then,  honestly,  the  content  was  really \n cute.  Wait,  added  tea.  I  know  him  and  I \n think  you  might  know  him  cuz  he  used  to \n make  Fortnite  videos  back  in  the  day  and \n I  collabed  with  him  back  in  the  day. \n Okay.  Anyways, \n Anyway,  so  they  start  making  couple \n content  together  and  then  about  a  week \n ago,  she  posts  a  video  titled  Q&A  with \n my  husband.  Okay.  And  I  remember  I \n watched  it  the  day  it  dropped.  Well,  I \n watched  half  of  it.  Then  I  had  some  [ __ ] \n to  do,  but  I  watched  like  half  of \n it.  And  they  just  answered  questions \n about  difficulties  they've  had  during \n their  relationship,  this  that  and  a  hat, \n whatever. \n Literally  two  days \n later,  two  days  later,  she  posts  a  set \n of  IG  stories  where  she  goes,  \"I  would \n never  preach  something  that  I  don't \n practice.  I  mean  everything  that  I \n say.  I  caught  Landon  talking  to  a  girl \n on  Snapchat  and  trying  to  meet  up  with \n her.  I'm  ending  our \n marriage.  He  said  that  our  relationship \n is  fake.  She  goes  into  a  bunch  of \n different  things.  She's  like,  \"He's  in \n Dallas  with  my  cats  right  now.  I'm  going \n to  figure  out  a  way  get  them.\"  Blah  blah \n blah.  But  like,  this  relationship  is \n over.  Oh  my  god.  Yeah.  Also,  I'm  four \n months  pregnant. \n That's  sad.  That's  very  sad. \n And  let  me  give  you  some  additional \n details  about  the  relationship. \n I  would  say  the  relationship  Oh, \n actually  they  said  the  relationship \n lasted  about  10  months.  They  met  when \n they  were  both  on \n layover  flights  in  a  random  airport.  Oh, \n okay.  Though  they  had  spoken  through \n IGDMs  like  3  years  prior  and  then  they \n both  got  into  relationships  and  then \n yeah,  they  just  happened  to  be  in  the \n same  airport,  cross  each  other  and  they \n made  it  sound  very  like \n serendipitous.  Also,  she's  someone  who \n talks  a  lot  about  like  manifesting  the \n dream  life  that  you  want,  things  like \n that.  He  does,  too.  And  so,  when  they \n talk  about  how  they  met,  sometimes  he'll \n describe  it  like,  well,  I  just  felt  like \n there  was  a  force  leading  me  this  way, \n and  when  I  stepped  towards  Liz,  it  kind \n of  felt  like  I  was  entering  this  new \n universe.  You  know,  that  kind  of  thing. \n And  he'll  call  her  like  the  answer  to \n his  prayers.  Oh  my  god.  Another  thing \n she  wrote  in  her  like  breakup  IG \n stories,  girl,  she's  like  talking  about \n how  this  guy  cheated  on  her  and  then  she \n goes,  \"He  was  also  writing  a  book  about \n me.\"  Okay.  And  I'm  four  months  pregnant. \n It's  like  the  the  the  levels  to  it,  you \n know.  Anyways,  yeah.  So,  they  met  like \n that,  fell  deeply  in  love,  I  guess,  and \n then  got  married  slashengaged.  No,  got \n engaged  two  months  later.  Got \n married,  I  think  near  the  same  time, \n actually.  likely.  So  I  think  they  got \n engaged  and  married  within  like  3  to \n four  months  and  then  she  got  pregnant \n probably  on \n month  sixish  five  sixish  and  then  yeah \n month  10.  This  is  a  very  fast  romance. \n Girl,  there's  more  tea.  Okay.  Landon  is \n kooky  respectfully  in  that  moment.  I \n don't  know  him  personally.  We  just \n played  Fortnite  together  six  years  ago. \n He  goes  on  his  IG  story,  starts  yapping. \n Why  you  doing  that?  What?  For  what?  And \n what  he \n says  no  one  wanted  to  hear.  What  was  it, \n girl?  You  know  what?  Let's  play  a  fun \n game.  Imagine  the  worst  possible  excuses \n you  could  give  in  this  scenario.  Go. \n [Music] \n Um,  I  was \n possessed  by  someone  else.  I  was  not  in \n my  right  head.  I  made  the  worst  mistake \n of  my  life.  I  I  would  do  anything  for  a \n second  to  I  I'm  very  sorry.  I  I  These \n are  good  stuff.  Actually,  there's  no \n sorry.  No  sorry.  No  sorry.  Um,  she  made \n me  do  it. \n Okay,  let's  relax.  She  persuaded  me  to \n do  it.  Well,  actually,  there  was \n something  a  little  along  those  lines. \n Not  the  maid  or  not  the  persuaded.  So, \n he  starts  off  the  stories  by  saying, \n \"I'm  not \n here  to  apologize  or  to  ask  for  your \n guy's \n forgiveness,  but  I  would  like  some \n understanding.\"  Okay.  Also,  why  go  speak \n to  your  wife?  Why  you  on  IG  stories, \n brother?  All  good  though.  So,  he  starts \n off  like  that  and  long  story  short,  he \n says,  \"I  made  a  mistake  in  a  moment  of \n weakness, \n whatever  that  means.\"  That's  my  bingo \n sheet  of  No,  like  that's  me  at  2  a.m. \n when  I  crack  open  a  pint  of  ice  cream. \n But  if  I  cheated  on  my  pregnant  wife,  I \n would  not  be  saying  that  on  IG  stories. \n That  is  insane.  Yeah.  He  also  he  alludes \n to  some  things  like  of  course  he  says  I \n don't  think  that  this  should  have  been \n aired  out  publicly.  Of  course  you  don't. \n And  then  he  says  there's  a  lot  of  things \n about  the  relationship  that  I'm  not \n going  to  talk  about  things  she's  done. \n You  can't  say  that  though.  I  know  you \n can't  do  that.  I  also  know  she  would \n never  be  the  type  Well,  I  don't  even \n know  her  personally.  Look  at  me  getting \n parasocial.  Um  she  just  doesn't  seem \n like  the  type  who  would  be  disloyal  in \n that  way.  Is  she  a  perfect  partner? \n don't  know  them.  But  I  don't  like  that \n he's  alluding  to  it  being  her  fault  in \n any  way  whatsoever  or  like  the \n relationship  being  in  a  place  where  he \n feels  so  lost  that  he  was  so  weak  that \n he  had  to  have  to  message  that  girl  on \n Snapchat.  You  don't  understand.  N  girl, \n it  gets  worse.  Yeah.  Honestly,  a  lot  of \n the  stories  I  think  was  just  him  kind  of \n minimizing  what  he  did  in  the  sense  that \n he's  like  in  a  moment  of  weakness,  I \n just  reached  out  to  this  girl.  I  was \n just  messaging  this  girl.  I  didn't \n actually  do  anything.  You  know  what  I \n mean? \n And  saying,  \"I  love  Liz  so  much.  I  would \n do  anything  for  her  except  not  message  a \n girl  on  Snapchat.\"  Um,  and  he  says,  \"In \n the  last  10  months  of  my  life,  I've  done \n absolutely  everything  that  I  can.\"  Okay. \n Wait.  Yeah.  Sorry,  that \n was  He  reminds  me  of  evil \n Kermit  talking  to  the  good  Kermit.  You \n know,  if  you  can  pull  up  that  photo, \n too.  Oh,  girl,  we're  going  to  get  into \n that,  too.  It's  really  piping  this  week. \n The  whole  time  he  was  like  laidback  with \n the  hood  and  I  could  not  stop  thinking \n of  evil \n Kermit.  Do  you  know  what  I'm  talking \n about?  That's  what  I  mean. \n Anyways, \n so  yes,  in  the  stories,  he's  kind  of \n just  minimizing  what  happened  and  he's \n saying,  \"I  only  talked  to  her  the  last \n 10  months.  All  I've  been  doing  is  trying \n to  make  her  happy.\"  No,  no,  no.  I'm  not \n saying  we  should  play  it.  I  was  just \n pulling  it  up  for  the  evil  Kermit \n reference.  Um,  yes.  And  then,  okay,  two, \n three  hours  later,  I  think  he  sees \n nobody's  taking  his  side,  so  he  deletes \n the  stories. \n And  then  he  posts  a  DM  that  he  got  from \n one  of  her  fans,  saying  something  along \n the  lines  of,  \"You  just  threw  away  a \n life  you  could  have  had  with  a  beautiful \n wife  and  a  beautiful  baby  for  like \n nothing.  You  think  that  you're  this \n great  person,  but  this  is  who  you  really \n are.  Also,  I  can't  believe  you  would \n call  this  relationship  fake  when  she's \n so  devoted  to  you.\"  Blah  blah  blah  blah. \n Yes.  And  then  he  responds  to  it  and  he \n goes,  \"I  didn't  create  an  account  to \n message  someone.  I  opened  an  app  I've \n had  for  years  and  I  messaged  someone \n from  the  past.  Weak  and  not  okay.  Our \n marriage  is  not  technically  legal,  but \n she  is  my  wife,  so  it's  fake  in  some \n way,  but  real  in  every  other.\"  Again, \n sent  a  couple  texts,  immediately  felt \n bad,  should  not  have  done  that.  Owning \n it.  So,  a  lot  of  what  he's  posted  is  him \n being  like,  \"I  made  a  mistake.\"  And  good \n people  own  their  mistakes,  so  I'm  owning \n it.  M  you  get  me.  How  are  you  feeling  so \n far? \n Okay,  I'm  getting  I'm  understanding  this \n whole  situation.  I  just  feel  like  I \n would  know  way  more  about  these  people \n than  I  would  have  go  on.  Is  there  more \n to  this?  Yes.  So,  this  is  kind  of  day \n one  rebuttalish.  Uhhuh.  So,  he  posted \n this  response  and  then  he  deleted  it.  I \n actually  want  to  shed  some  light  on  this \n marriage  technicality.  So  when  he \n Snapchated  this  girl,  she  was  asking  him \n about  the  relationship.  Well,  she  was \n calling  it  a  marriage  and  he  was \n basically  saying  like,  \"No,  I'm  not \n married.\"  And  she's  like,  \"You  literally \n are.\"  And  he's  like,  \"No,  it's \n complicated.\"  Blah  blah  blah  blah  blah \n blah.  The  reason  he's  playing  around \n this  technicality,  I  think,  is  something \n I've  speculated  in  other  people  online. \n Uh  Liz  has  talked  about  in  the  past \n being  Muslim  and  in  Islam  there's \n basically  like  a  sort  of  marriage  or  vow \n that  you  make  to  one  another  in  a \n religious  sense  like  before  God  as \n opposed  to \n like  having  a  government  wedding  and \n signing  papers  whatnot.  I  do  think  there \n might  be  papers  you  sign  though.  So  I \n think  that  they  got  religiously  married \n but  not  legally  married.  Mhm.  But \n obviously  if  you  do  that  and  if  you \n choose  to  do  that  with  your  wife,  I  feel \n like  in  your  mind  you  should  be  married. \n Yeah.  So  I  I  don't  know  why  he's  saying \n that  and  I  think  it's  suspicious.  Legal \n or  not,  you  guys  both  made  that \n commitment  to  each  other  before  God  or \n not  or  whatever.  You  chose  to  do  that. \n So  that  kind  of  pissed  me  off.  Anyway, \n so  that  was  day  one.  Mhm.  You  won't \n believe  what  happened  next.  What \n happened  next? \n Of  course,  he  deleted  that  story,  too. \n Uhhuh.  The  next \n day,  I  don't  know  what  took  over  him.  He \n posted  the  entire  conversation  with  the \n girl  from  Snapchat.  Oh  jeez.  Everything \n he  has  posted  on  his  story  has  only  made \n him  look  worse.  And  this  girl,  it  was \n the  nail  in  the  coffin.  Bunk  bunk  bunk. \n What  was  it?  What  was  the  text?  Um, \n maybe  we  pull  that  up  cuz  I  I  don't  have \n that  at  the  top  of  my  mind. \n But  I  almost  feel  bad  for  him.  I  don't \n really,  but  almost \n because  I  feel  like  he  was  trying  to \n defend  himself  thinking  someone  someone \n out  there  would  take  his  side.  But  the \n thing  is  her  audience  is  like  so  devoted \n to  him.  Sorry.  Her  audience  is  so \n devoted  to  her \n [Music] \n and  of  course  they  have  the  same  mindset \n as  her.  They  think  the  same  things  that \n she  thinks  are  right  or \n wrong.  So  I  don't  know  why  he  thought \n they  might  take  his  side.  So  odd.  So \n Landon  messages  this  girl  on  Snapchat \n and  says,  \"Are  you  still  in  Dallas?\"  She \n says,  \"Yeah,  why?\"  He  says,  \"Just \n wondering  who  who  all  I  know  is  still \n here.  I  just  got  back  from  London  in  New \n York  City  Tuesday,  then  back  in  Dallas \n for  a  week.  Do  you  have  plans?  She  says, \n \"Aren't  you \n married?\"  He \n goes,  \"Yeah,  that  he  I  I  got  it.  I  got \n it.\"  He  goes,  \"No,  plus  I'm  just  looking \n for  friends.\"  She  says,  \"Since  when \n aren't  you \n married?\"  He  says,  \"Yeah,  well,  it's  a \n complicated \n longdistance  internet  thing,  but  no,  I'm \n not  married.  Not  a  normal  life  for \n sure.\"  And  she  says,  \"So  your  whole \n relationship  is \n fake.\"  He  says,  \"No,  it's  not,  but  I'm \n not  married.  That  part  is  not  real.\" \n Cookie  beans.  She  says,  \"What  does  that \n even \n mean?\"  Fair \n question.  He  says,  \"Haha,  do  you  want  to \n see  me?\"  I  don't  know  why  reading  that \n made  me  want  to  yak.  Do  you  want  to  see \n me?  Cuz  also,  I  just  don't  think  I  would \n enjoy  a  man  saying,  \"Do  you  want  to  see \n me?\"  Like  what?  Naked  or  clothed?  Where? \n In  public,  at  a  coffee  shop.  I  don't \n know  if  I  want  to  see  anyone  to  be \n honest.  Just  an  odd  way  to  phrase  it. \n Ha,  do  you  want  to  see  me?  Um,  I  can \n tell  you  in  person.  She  says,  I  don't \n want  to  hang  out  with  married  men. \n Respect.  And  I  saw  you  wearing  a  wedding \n ring.  Also  respect.  He  says,  \"Well, \n that's  fair,  but  no,  not  married.\"  She \n screenshots  the  wedding  ring  and  sends \n like  screenshots  a  photo  of  him  wearing \n a  wedding  ring  and  sends  it  to  him. \n with  a  crying  of  laughter  emoji,  which \n we  also  are  crying  of  laughter  emoji. \n And  he  says,  \"Oh  god,  that's  worn  for \n the \n video.\"  Like  laughing  emoji,  but  never \n mind.  It's  complicated.  She  says, \n \"Explain.\"  He  says,  \"No.\"  Haha.  Never \n mind.  I  told  you  it's  complicated.  Not \n legally  married.  Maybe  will  be.  Maybe  is \n crazy.  She's  four  months  pregnant  with \n your  child.  Anyways,  either  way,  if \n you're  in  a  relationship,  you  shouldn't \n be  trying  to  hang  out  with  girls,  is \n what  the  girl  responded,  which  is  very \n sweet.  He  says,  \"Why  were  you  going  to \n come  courtside  with  me  then?  Just \n curious,  but  your  point  is  valid.\"  She \n says,  \"What's  your  point?  You  invited  my \n boyfriend  and  I  and  we  never \n came.\"  A  boyfriend?  She  does.  Yeah,  I \n guess.  I  don't  really  know  the \n situation.  And  I  mean,  clearly  he  didn't \n know  because  he  says,  \"I  didn't  know  you \n had  a  boyfriend.\" \n And  no,  no,  not  trying  to  pull  a  fast \n one  on  you.  Was  just  curious.  She  says, \n \"But  you  said  it  yourself.  You  are  in  a \n relationship  right  now,  so  why  are  you \n trying  to  hang  out  with  me?\"  He  says, \n \"Well,  was  not  trying  to  date  you,  but \n you're  right.  Even  if  the  situation  is \n complicated \n or  unresolved,  I  shouldn't  message  you. \n I  am  sorry.  Maybe  I'll  explain  more  one \n day.\"  Yeah.  Okay. \n Um,  so  that's  kind  of  the  gist  of  what \n happened.  Long  story  short,  I  guess  the \n only  missing  detail  is  that  ever  since \n this  occurred,  people  have  been  looking \n back  into  their  couple  content  or  any \n information  that  was  posted  about  them \n online.  And  people  have  kind  of  started \n speculating  or  I  should  say \n psychoanalyzing  him  from  a  perspective \n of,  \"Oh  my  god,  did  this  guy  stalk  her? \n Was  it  really  a  serendipitous  meeting  at \n the  airport?  Or  was  he  trying  to  set \n this  up?  Did  he  watch  a  bunch  of  her \n content  for  all  of  these  years  and \n idolize  her  and  know  what  kind  of  man \n she  wanted?  So  he  tried  to  portray  that \n in  order  to  get  her  and  then  once  he  got \n her  kind  of  this \n unfolded  mainly  because  of  the  random \n way  in  which  they  met  one  and  also  two \n just  little  things  that  he  would  say \n like  in  their  husband  Q&A.  He  said \n something  along  the  lines  of  you  know \n when  I  was  in  the  relationship  prior  to \n this  one  like  they  were  both  in \n relationships  broke  up  then  got \n together.  He  said,  \"When  I  was  with  my \n ex  and  we  would  have  these  disagreements \n or  fights  and  maybe  I  was  kind  of \n dissatisfied  with  the \n relationship, \n a  like  a  nice  thought  that  I  would  have \n is  I'd  be  like,  \"Oh,  it  does  suck  that \n we're  having  this  argument  or  that  she's \n being  this  way,  but  at least  there  are \n girls  like  the  wizard  Liz  out  there.\" \n And  he  said  that  he  would \n get  It's  just  funny  because  I  remember \n the  words.  He  goes,  I  would  get  uniquely \n excited  when  you  would  message  me,  even \n when  he  was  with  the  other  girl.  I  don't \n know  why  uniquely  excited.  It's  just  so \n funny.  I  so  understand  the \n premise.  I've  just  never  heard  those  two \n words  be  put  together.  Okay,  the  last \n thing  I'll  say  before  I'd  love  to  hear \n your  thoughts. \n Um,  it's  interesting  to  see  how  much \n this  relationship  was  idolized  prior  to \n this  revelation, \n even  though  it  was  clearly  a  pretty \n quick  relationship  that  they  kind  of \n jumped \n into.  And  then  also  kind  of  when  the \n flip  thing  occurs  when  something  bad \n happens,  I  wonder  if  people  start \n villainizing  things  too  much.  I'm \n curious  what  you  think.  It  always  feels \n like  it's  one  extreme  or  the  other, \n like,  \"Oh  my  god,  they're  perfect  for \n each  other  or  he's  a  crazy  cookie  bean \n stalker.\"  Yeah.  It's  one  of  those  like \n angel  like  I  guess  you  just  don't  know \n what  actually  is  people's  relationships. \n Like  they're  just  choosing  to  showcase \n all  the  pretty  parts,  but  you  don't \n actually  know  them.  You  don't  know \n what's  going  on  behind  the  scenes.  It \n kind  of  reminds  me  of  like  like  I  I  hear \n about  like  when  I  hear  about \n relationship  dramas  like  this,  it's  like \n wow,  we  really  don't  know  anything  until \n it  comes  out.  So,  it's  like  such  a  shock \n to  everyone.  But  maybe  I  don't  know  if \n she  had  a  feeling  or  she  knew  a  bit \n more.  I'm  not  sure.  Either  way,  it \n seemed  really  fast,  too.  Like  from \n meeting  to  marry  to  pregnant  to  bam, \n cheating.  Like,  wow.  I  would \n say  maybe  a  little  lesson  in  taking  it \n easy,  taking  it  slow.  Um,  and  that  the \n right  things  don't  need  to  be  rushed.  Do \n you  feel  like  he  bullyfully  cheated  or \n what  would  you  consider  his  behavior? \n How  would  you  respond  if  this  was  your \n man's  and  you  were  four  months  pregnant? \n I'd  say  that  it's  emotionally  cheating. \n Yeah.  Like  cuz  like  if  if  another  if \n like \n Michael  someone  on  Snapchat  asking  to \n meet  up,  that's  if  Michael  had  Snapchat. \n If  Michael  cared  enough  to  have  social \n media  or  use  social  media.  Yeah,  that's \n Yeah,  I  would  consider  that  like  a \n betrayal.  Like  you  would  think  like  if \n your  boyfriend  did  that  like  that's \n weird  mode  for  me  was  especially  the  oh \n no  no  no  it's  fake.  That's  that's  sad. \n Like  calling  a  relationship  fake  is  sad. \n Yeah.  Like  if  you  want  to  hang  out  with \n someone \n and  I  don't \n know  and  there's  like  degrees  to  it \n there  even  without  the  calling  the \n relationship  fake.  It's  a  little  like \n Yeah.  And  don't  get  me  wrong  suspicious. \n But  of  course,  married  men  can  still \n have  friends  that  are  girls.  Just  the \n context  of  it  all  was  a  bit  odd.  But \n once  he  got  into  No,  no,  no,  no,  no.  The \n relationship  is  fake.  It's  like,  oh, \n this  ring  is  worn  for  content.  Why  would \n you  even  need  to  No,  but  on  on  the  other \n hand,  I  do  empathize  like  cuz  like  my \n relationship  with  Michael  is  all \n content.  Every  single  bit  of  it  is  fake. \n Like  we've  been  going  strong  fake  ring. \n Tell  him  to  bring  it  up.  We're  planning \n a  wedding  arc  soon.  So,  is  it  going  to \n be  streamed  or  is  part  of  it  that  it's \n like,  \"Oh,  no,  no,  no.  It's  going  to  be \n more  authentic  if  we  don't  stream  it.\" \n See,  we're  kind  of  debating  that,  right? \n Cuz  like  in  one  hand,  we  want  to  milk \n it,  but  on  the  other  hand,  we  do  want \n people  to  think  like  it's  like  genuine \n and  real  and  stuff,  so  we  want  it  off \n stream.  So,  we're  still  like,  you  know, \n weighing  the  pros  and  cons.  Let  me  know \n what  you  think  in  the  comments  below. \n Who's  script  writing  your  fake \n relationship?  Just  wondering.  Most  of \n the  ideation  is  me,  but  he  does  have \n some  banger  ideas  sometimes.  Like  the \n honey  thing  was  his  idea,  you  know?  Oh, \n yeah.  We're  like  I'm  like,  \"Is  that  too \n obviously  like  fake?\"  But  he's  like, \n \"No,  no,  no.  People  will  love  it  and \n it's  been  working  so  far.\"  Well,  you \n know,  if  the  script  writers  ever  want  to \n write  in  a  a  breakup  run,  oh  my  god, \n juicy.  We  were  We  were  considering  it  in \n my  line.  Anyway,  um  what  was  I  talking \n about?  This  in  general.  Oh,  yeah.  No, \n it's  very  sad,  especially  cuz  she's \n pregnant.  Like,  imagine  cheating  on  your \n [ __ ]  pregnant  wife.  Like,  I  I  don't \n know.  It  just  kind  of  hurts  a  little  bit \n more.  I'm  not  saying  a  little  bit.  I'm \n not  saying  like  all  like  there's  degrees \n of  Bro,  this  made  me  want  to  never \n consume  content  ever  again  because  I'm \n like  this  is  all  false  data  for  my  poor \n little  brain.  Emphasis  on \n little,  you  know,  you  got  to  feed  it \n good  information.  So,  when  I'm  watching \n these  couple  videos  and  they're  saying \n certain  things  and  I'm  like,  \"Oh,  well, \n this  looks  like  a  healthy  couple.  I \n guess  I  should  believe  what  they're \n saying.\"  And  then  the  behind  the  scenes \n is  just  [ __ ]  180.  Not  at  all  what  you \n expect,  I'm  like,  I  feel  like  I'm  being \n brainwashed.  And  two,  it  made  me  afraid \n to  ever  get  pregnant.  And  three,  okay, \n okay,  okay.  From  an  optics  perspective, \n it  made  me  wonder,  let's  say  I  got \n married.  Okay.  Oh  my  god.  Pokey  wedding \n manifesting  for  2027.  Low  key.  I  2027. \n Yeah.  No,  2028  because  I  would  want  to \n know  them  at least  like  two  years.  [ __ ] \n I  mean,  unless  it  was  you.  I  would,  but \n Oh,  my  wedding  would  be  such  a  banger, \n dude.  That's  what  I  mean.  Oh,  god.  It'd \n be  so  cute.  Your  wedding  dress.  Everyone \n goes  home.  I  have  to  figure  out  a  gift \n for  everyone.  No,  you  don't  got  it.  It's \n your  wedding.  No,  but  that's  the  fun  of \n it.  I  know,  but  like  Okay,  anyways,  back \n to  the  optics.  Let's  say  I  married \n someone.  Okay,  then  I  have  I  don't  know. \n I'm  pregnant  with  their  baby.  Crazy.  Or \n I  have  the  kid  came  out  of  my  chart. \n Whatever.  And  then  what  if  they  cheat  on \n me?  I  was  thinking,  hear  me  out  for \n after  watching  this  I'm  like  from  a  PR \n perspective  they're  losing  me  millions \n or  are  they  gaining  me  millions?  No, \n they're  los,  you  know,  like  that's \n millions  of  dollars  in  kind  of \n potentially  negative  PR.  Now  I'm  like, \n what's  my  prenup  ever  going  to  look \n like?  Should  I  never  get  pregnant? \n Negative  PR  for  you?  Well,  I  don't  think \n it  would  be  for  people  would  think \n you're  a  victim  here.  1,000%.  Really? \n Yes.  I  don't  know.  Why  don't  we wait? \n Why?  Let's  explore  that.  Why?  I  don't \n know.  You  think  if  you  were  pregnant  and \n it's  still  Listen,  even  if  we  look  at \n this  and  we're \n like  she  is  the  victim  100%.  Mhm.  But \n it's  still  not  something  she  wants  to  go \n through.  Even  if  you  consider  it  No,  I \n know.  It's  probably  the  worst  moment  in \n her  life  that's  being  publicized.  Yes,  I \n know  a  lot  about  that.  Maybe  instead  of \n PR  also  Oh, \n babe.  Yeah,  you  do.  Yeah,  you  do.  You \n can  relate.  So,  you  know,  if  you  were  to \n put  a  dollar  amount  on  the  pain  you  went \n through,  what  would  that  be? \n Ooh,  I  had  I  remember  when  something \n similar  happened  where  like,  oh, \n cheating  public  blah  blah  blah.  And  I \n got  a  [ __ ]  ton  of  new  audience  and \n viewers  from  that,  right?  I  remember \n thinking  in  the  moment,  I  don't  care \n about  any  of  that.  I'd  rather  have  not \n gone  through  any  of  that  pain.  So  maybe \n she  feels  similarly  like  I'd  rather  just \n not  go  through  this,  you  know?  Like  who \n wants  to  get  cheated  on?  No  one.  Nobody. \n Unless  you're  like  a  cuck  muscle.  I \n don't  know.  Very  good  disclaimer.  I \n heard  that  California  is  introducing  a \n cheating  law  or  something.  What?  Yeah. \n Did  you  guys  hear?  I  don't  know.  Can  we \n pull  it  up?  I  still  can't  believe  he \n released  the  Snapchat  messages  himself. \n Wait,  wait,  wait.  I  glossed  over  one \n very  important  detail.  What's  up?  But \n let's  finish  this  law  first.  in \n California.  Adult. \n There's  no  No,  not  the  AI.  Not  the  AI.  I \n saw  something. \n There's  no  It  says,  \"Girl,  it's  fake \n news.\"  Uh,  sorry.  I'm  logging  off.  Mhm. \n You  You  got  You  got  get  rage  baited.  You \n got  rage  baited  by  Broden,  too.  Last \n head  in  the  clouds.  Wait,  I  swear  to \n God,  it's  the  last  head  of  the  clouds.  I \n swear.  I'm  so  sure  it's  not.  We'll  see. \n Anyways,  one  important  detail  I  glossed \n over.  So,  in  the  Snapchat \n messages,  I  don't  know  exactly  when,  but \n early  on  in  the  relationship,  I  think  as \n soon  as  she  asks  if  he's  married,  he \n turned  on  like  this  mode  on  Snapchat \n where  messages  like  instantly  delete. \n Oh,  that's  weird.  I  know.  I  I  think  he's \n just  trying  to  like  It  just  felt  like  he \n was  trying  to  downplay  it  like,  \"Oh,  the \n relationship  wasn't  fake.  I  wasn't \n actually  married.  I  was  just  for  the \n camera.  Oh,  it's  really  complicated.  You \n wouldn't  understand.\"  blah  blah  blah  and \n then  at  the  very  end  trying  to  backpedal \n like  oh  you  know  like  I  like  yeah  you're \n valid  for  that  blah  blah  blah  but  you \n like  the  damage  is  done  you  still  did \n the  thing  it's  just  [ __ ]  you  know  if \n I  was  her  I'd  be  so  scared  thinking  if \n someone's  willing  to  do  this  to  me  10 \n months  in  while  I'm  four  months  pregnant \n with  their  baby  what  else  could  they  do \n like  if  they  can  justify  that  in  a \n situation  like  this  I've  seen  like \n people  who  cheat  they  they  cheat  on  like \n they're  pregnant  pregnant  you  know \n pregnant  essos  or  like  people  with \n children  or  like  I've  seen  like  people \n cheat  on  people  with  like  [ __ ] \n life-threatening  illness.  Like  cheating \n has  like  no  boundaries  from  what  I've \n observed  and  it  can  happen  to  anyone. \n Scary.  It  is  very  scary  and  it  makes  you \n think  every  time  you  go  into  a  new \n relationship  you're  basically  like \n trusting  that  person,  you  know,  100% \n like  I  you  will  not  hurt  me.  So  when  it \n does  happen,  it's  like  a  [ __ ]  knife \n to  your  heart.  You're  like,  \"Oh  my  god, \n I  will  never  love  again.  I  will  never \n see  light  again.  But  then  you  do  and \n sometimes  it's  the  best  relationship \n ever  and  it  was  all  worth  it  and  you \n should  never  kill  yourself.  Thanks \n Pokey.  You're  welcome.  That's  a  good  b \n good  banging  lines.  Really?  Yeah.  No, \n don't  kill  yourself.  Things  can  get \n better.  I  agree.  I  agree. \n It's  a  cool  topic.  I  mean,  it's \n interesting,  you  know,  like  the  public. \n Girl,  you  haven't  seen  the  amount  of \n commentary  on  this.  Imagine  what  it's \n like.  I'm  amazing  what  people  are \n saying.  Why  did  he  show  this  to  all \n those  Insta  stories?  Actually,  people \n aren't  talking  so  much  about  his \n behavior  post \n the  revelation,  per  se,  um  or  post  the \n cheating.  They're  mainly  just  saying \n stuff  like,  \"And  this  is  why  you  can \n never  trust  a  man  and  something \n something  money  something  something.\" \n which  I  feel  like  is  not  the  right \n conclusion  to  come  out  of  this  with \n I  think  just  all  the  love  to  her  for \n dealing  with  it.  I  agree.  That  is  very \n hard  and  she's  going  to  be  such  a  good \n mom  and  I  don't  know  I  feel  for  her  but \n I  really  really  wish  her  the  best.  Yeah. \n So  let's  talk  about  the  issue  at  hand. \n Cheating  or  like  micro  cheating.  I  do \n find  it  so  interesting  the  idea  of  micro \n cheating.  Do  you  think \n that's  a  fair  term  to  use?  I  feel  like \n or  should  it  be  like  emotional  cheating, \n physical  cheating,  black  and  white?  I \n think  cheating  is  cheating  for  me.  Like \n either  way,  it's  like  a  betrayal  of  like \n that  other  person's  boundaries.  It  could \n be  anything,  right?  That's  true.  Like  to \n some  people  it'll  be  a  different \n definition.  For  some  people,  maybe  they \n don't  give  a  [ __ ]  Hey,  your  boundaries \n are  different  with  every  relationship. \n It's  just  that  you  have  to  like  talk  to \n the  I  think  a  good  example  is  I  think \n some  some  couples  are  comfortable  for \n example  going  out  and  like  the  person \n will  like  each  person  might  talk  to \n someone  else  and  have  conversations  that \n might  seem  or  even  be  flirty  and  neither \n people  in  the  relationship  actually  take \n issue  with  that.  Um  maybe  for  them \n cheating  or  the  boundaries  are  more \n physical.  But  some  relationships  it's \n like  well  this  is  kind  of  the  confines \n of  the  relationship.  We  don't  talk  to \n other  people  in  any  sort  of  way.  Even \n slight  flirting  or  what  might  seem \n flirty  is \n cheating.  I  I  guess  that's  the  only \n issue  though  sometimes  when  people  don't \n have  that  conversation  and  then  what  one \n person  deems  as  cheating  the  other \n person  didn't.  I  see  that.  I  get  that \n thought  too. \n I  think  there  is  like  a  general  you  know \n definition  though  like  yes  I  mean \n messaging  people  on  Snapchat  is  very \n clearly  Snapchat \n Snapchat  telling  them  your  relationship \n is  fake  that's  not  that's  not  some \n friend  go \n also  I  think  that  do  you  want  to  see  me \n scra  that's  funny \n too  yeah  oh  my  god  I  just  kept  my  cat \n I'm  trying  to  imagine  Michael  on \n Snapchat  doing  that  and  I'm  like  there's \n just  crazy.  I  can't  imagine  Michael  on \n Snapchat  period.  That's  what  I  read. \n It's  crazy.  The  dude's  probably  in  his \n garage  building  his  um  I  don't  know \n Fortnite \n his  Fortnite  toilet  that  runs  off  a \n scooter  or  something.  Yeah.  Um  are  there \n any  red  flags  you've  ignored  in  the \n past?  Dude,  when  I  read  that  prompt,  the \n first  one  that  came  to  mind  are  guys  who \n you \n Yeah,  that's  a  throwback. \n Congrats  to  those  who  got  it.  You're  in \n a  club.  Mhm.  Um,  guys  who  say  things \n like,  \"Oh,  you're  not  like  other  girls \n I've  met.\"  Dude,  I  fell  for  that  when  I \n was  younger.  Put  you  on  a  pedestal  above \n other  women  they've  dated  or  other  girls \n in  general.  Yeah,  I  don't  like  that.  But \n when  I  was  way  younger,  I  didn't  know \n better.  And  you're  flattered  by  the \n idea.  Yeah.  And  the  guy  like  You're \n like, \"Wait,  isn't  that  the  point  to \n date  someone  who  thinks  you're  different \n and  special?\"  Like,  I  don't  usually  find \n girls  funny,  Lily,  but  you're  actually \n really  funny.  And  I'm  like,  \"Really?\" \n And  I  was  so  young  and  stupid  and  naive, \n I  believed  it.  And  he's  like, \"Yeah, \n you're  like  the  funniest  girl  I  know.\" \n I'm  like,  \"Oh,  all  right.  Thanks.\"  But \n now  I  don't  like  anything  that  puts  down \n other  people  to  lift  you  up.  I  don't \n like  that.  I  think  it's  bad.  I \n completely  agree.  That's  a  that's  that's \n a  good  red  flag.  Another  red  flag  for  me \n was  like  um  like  stonewalling,  like  when \n you're  trying  to  talk  to  them  about \n something  and  they  just  respond  with \n like  one  letter  or  one  word  and  it's \n like  you  feel  so  stupid.  Like  why  did  I \n write  all  these  feelings  to  you  and  I \n get  less  than  nothing  back?  I  almost \n wish  people  were  taught  what  kind  of \n behavior \n is  bad  or  like  bordering  on  emotional \n abuse.  And  I  think  stonewalling  falls \n into  that  because,  you  know,  it's  not \n abuse  in  the  sense  of  like  you're \n physically  harming  someone,  but  when \n you're  kind  of  playing  with  someone's \n emotions  by  giving  Yeah.  giving  them \n attention  when  they  behave  the  way  that \n you  want  and  then  pulling  away  that \n attention  when  they  do  something  you \n don't  want,  even  if  it's  perfectly \n normal.  You're  conditioning  this  person \n in  a  way  that  long  term  will  likely \n cause  them  some  level  of  trauma.  And \n that's  not  good.  And  it's  crazy  that \n some  people  do  that  and  walk  around \n without  even  realizing  that  what  they're \n doing  is  bad.  No,  they  have  no  idea. \n Yeah.  They're  like,  \"La,  I'm  perfect.\" \n Dude,  I  just  got  Oh  my  god.  I  remember \n once  long  ago  in  past  bad  relationships \n many  have  had.  Anyway,  there  was  one \n time  we  know  that's  a  call  back  to  every \n episode. \n I  was  like  PMSing  really  bad,  right? \n Yeah.  Like  I  have  really  bad  PMS \n symptoms  where  I'll  get  really  like \n emotional  and  sad  and  like  I  usually \n give  people  a  heads  up  like,  \"Hey,  just \n so  I'ming  it's  not  you,  it's  me.  If  I'm \n a  little  cranky,  so  be  it.\"  Right? \n Anyway,  it  was  like  that  time  of  month \n and  I  was  like  being  I  was  trying  to \n explain  this  to  the  guy  I  was  dating  at \n the  time.  Like,  you  know,  I'm  just  like \n all  stuff.  He  goes  to  his  other  female \n friend  and  says,  \"Dude,  Lily's  saying \n this  and  this  and  this.  Is  this  true?\" \n And  she's  like,  \"No.  Is  the  menstrual \n cycle  true?\"  No.  But  she's  like,  \"No, \n that's  not  an  excuse.\"  She  was  not  a \n girl's  girl.  She's  like, \"Yeah,  just \n because  you're  PMS  doesn't  mean  you're \n like  always  moody  and  stuff.  Like, \n that's  just  an  excuse.  She's  just  using \n it  as  an  excuse  to  be  like  cranky  about \n all  this  stuff.\"  and  he  believed  her  and \n it  told  me  and  I  remember  thinking  like \n oh  my  god  I  should  have  ran  at  that \n point.  Were \n you  how  young  under  or  above  18?  Not \n even  from  a  you  perspective.  I'm  curious \n about  the  girl.  The  girl  was  above  18. \n Right.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  So  I  was  like \n whoa  that's  that's  kooky,  man.  That's  it \n made  me  feel  like  crazy.  Like,  oh  my \n god,  it's  I'm  the  problem.  You  should \n have  asked  a  doctor.  Actually,  even \n then,  it  depends  on  the  doctor.  Gosh, \n there's  so  much  like  period \n misinformation.  My  favorite  thing  now, \n okay,  I  know  next  time  I'm  in  a  good, \n healthy,  committed  relationship.  I'm \n just  going  to  add  the  dude  to  my  period \n tracking  app  so  he'll  know,  am  I  in  the \n happy  phase \n or  the  don't  talk  to  me,  just  send  me \n food  phase?  Yeah,  I  tell  Michael  like, \n \"Sorry,  honey.  I'm  PMSing.\"  He's  like, \n \"Oh,  I  know.\" \n He  gives  me  so  much  [ __ ]  He's  like, \n \"Such  good  delivery.\"  I  can  see  him \n saying,  \"Serious  Sarah  over  here.\"  Like, \n he  started  using  alliteration  stuff. \n That's  so  cute. \n Cranky  Carly.  I  don't  [ __ ]  know  some \n stupiditeration  stuff.  Moody  Molly. \n Yeah.  Stuff  like  that.  And  I  started \n using  it,  too.  Petty  Peter. \n Bully  Brian.  Sorry,  I'll  stop.  Yeah,  I \n like  it.  You  know what's  the  worst?  Red \n flags  either  in  the  honeymoon  phase \n because  they  don't  look  like  red  flags \n or  like  when  you're  already  just  so  deep \n in  it,  you're  like,  I  just  see  red \n everywhere  or  I  see  nothing.  I'm  like \n I'm  color  blind.  Wait,  what  if  you  like \n started  the  red  flags?  So  to  you  the  red \n is  normal.  Yeah.  You  don't  know  it's  red \n a  lot  of  situations.  Yeah,  but  it's  so \n hard  when  you're  in  it.  Like,  you  know, \n even  if  I've  seen  instances  where  like \n all  the  friends  don't  [ __ ]  with  this, \n but  then  you're  so  deep  you're  blinded \n by  love  and  then  once  you're  free, \n you're  like,  \"How  did  I  swim  in  that  sea \n of  red  sort  of  vibe?\"  Yep.  That's  why \n now  I  tell  my  friends  every  little  thing \n ever.  I  do.  So  they  can  keep  me  in \n check.  Yeah,  I  do.  I  need  an  adult \n supervisor. \n Number  one,  don't  punch  the  couch.  Yeah, \n right.  That's  a  big  one. \n And  hopefully  not  me  either  afterwards. \n Number  two,  don't  cheat  on  you.  That's  a \n big  one.  Or  you.  Or  Yeah,  no  cheating.  I \n would  prefer  neither  of  us.  But  cheated \n on.  Yes.  Hey,  let's  let's  dab  me  up  for \n that. \n That  was  so  I  thought  you  wanted  to \n shake  hand.  Oh,  Pokey.  What  the  [ __ ] \n Why  would  you  do  that? \n I'm  so  glad  they  got  to  see  exactly  what \n we  mean.  It's  just  And  the  way  [ __ ]  is \n just  chilling  now  like  makes  it  sound \n like  you've  murdered  him.  And  he's  like, \n \"Well,  anyway,  every  time  on  stream  me \n up,  murdered  Binky.\" \n Oh  my  gosh.  Yummy.  You  You're  the \n normal.  You  know what's  kind  of  cute  to \n think  about?  As  we  do  this  podcast  and \n like  the  dogs  growing  up  with  us.  Yeah. \n It's  kind  of  cute.  Yeah.  And  then  one \n day  there  will  be  a  dog.  Stop.  I'm  going \n to  have  to  do  a  episode.  No,  that's  not \n No.  No.  Stop.  Stop.  We're  Tammy's  going \n to  live  forever.  Binky's  going to  live \n forever.  I'm  going  to  live  You're  going \n to  live  forever.  And  this  podcast  is \n going  to  live  forever.  Oh,  I  like  your \n optimism.  They're  going  to  play  this  in \n like  the  podcast  death  montage  and  it's \n going  to  be  a  gray  screen.  This  podcast \n is  good.  I  Dude,  I  always  wonder  like  um \n if  one  of  us  had  an  unlikely  death, \n right?  Okay.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I  don't \n ponder  about  that.  I  ponder.  I'm  happy. \n If  I  died,  what  would  be  the  last  thing? \n No,  no,  no.  I'm  not  going  to,  you  know, \n kill  myself  or  anything.  I'm  just  saying \n like,  no,  I  hope  not.  Now  I  have  to \n ponder  it.  No,  I'm  not.  I'm  not.  I'm \n saying  like  if  I  got  into  Are  you  sure? \n Something  happened  where  I  just  died. \n Let's  get  hit  by  a  car.  Promise  you \n won't.  Promise.  I'm  not  going.  I'm  too \n sexy.  Anyway,  and  then  like  what  would \n be  the  last  thing?  Because  some  of  so \n many  of  our  lives,  so  much  of  our  lives \n are  online,  right?  What  would  be  the \n last  thing?  The  last  thing  we  did  was \n that  Tik  Tok  that  Yeah.  What  if  that's \n like  the  last  thing? \n That  would  be  iconic. \n So  funny  cuz  it's  so  not  us.  They're \n like,  \"Damn,  they  went  out  with  a  bang. \n It  would  have  5  million  likes.\" \n People  would  be  like  coming  back  to \n like,  \"Damn,  this  was  their  this  was \n their  last  posted.  This  was  their  Magnum \n Opus.\" \n Oh,  that's  so  funny. \n I'm  like,  \"Tweet  every  tweet  like  it's \n your  last.\"  I  mean,  why  not? \n So,  I've  been  planning  a  trip  to  China. \n M  okay.  Wait,  actually  I  should  tell  you \n guys  we  were  going  to  go  to  Japan  like \n now,  but  not  anymore  and  not  now,  but \n maybe  someday  soon.  We  had  this  whole \n trip  planned.  It  was  going  to  be  really \n fun.  We  were  even  going  to  film  a \n podcast  episode  out  there.  We  could \n still  do  it  soon,  you  know,  just  saying. \n Um,  we  were  going  to  go  shopping.  We \n were  going  to  go  to  Kyoto.  We  were  going \n to  go  to  all  these  different  cities.  And \n I  think  we  still  will,  but  maybe  just \n not  right  now.  By  the  way,  I  feel  like \n every  time  I  think  of  Japan,  I  think  of \n you  because  the  first  time  I  went  was \n with  Lily.  Do  you  remember? \n We  were  babies.  Someone  put  up  a \n picture  sponsor.  This  was  when  I  didn't \n know  Pokey  like  that that  well.  We \n weren't  like  Yeah,  she  was  kind  of  shy \n or  whatever.  And  I  was  so  not  I  was  so \n extroverted.  It  was  like  the  It  was  like \n the  stereotypical  extroverted  the  E \n person  takes  out  the  I  person  to  go \n clubbing  and  dancing  and  like  just  going \n out  and  stuff.  I  remember  this  and  I'm \n like  dragging  her  on  the  dance  floor \n like  let's  go.  Yeah.  And  I'm  like  who? \n It  was  so  fun.  And  I  still  remember  how \n fun  not  just  of  a  trip  that  was  but  the \n sponsor.  The  sponsor  was  like  chill. \n Yeah.  It  was  this  horror  game.  So  cool. \n Great  graphics.  fun  storyline  and  it  was \n at  an  event  where  we  like  went  and \n promoted  it  and  played  and  whatever  and \n everybody  that  was  a  part  of  the  team \n was  so  nice.  It  was  just  like  such  a \n great  start  to  my  career,  especially \n being  in  LA  and  one  of  the  first  like \n cool  travel  things  I'd  ever  done. \n Yeah.  We  got  like  souvenirs.  I  remember \n we  walked  around  a  lot.  It  was  it  was \n the  first  time.  Yeah,  that  was  fun.  Do \n you  remember  the  taxi?  Um,  and  then  the \n taxi  driver  started  I  started  humming \n the  the  evangelian  theme  song.  Were  you \n I  feel  like  what  Jake \n is  this  a  clip?  It  was  a  clip.  I  think  I \n remember  it. \n He  started  singing  along.  That's  a  good \n memory.  And  then  so  cute.  Jake  gave  us \n caffeinated  cola.  Hell  yeah.  That  was \n good,  too.  Good  times.  So  good.  And  that \n was  the  first  time  that  I  discovered  the \n matcha  Tokyo,  which  is \n Such  a  good  matcha  spot.  So  good.  They \n have  them  in  Japan.  They  have  them  in \n China.  And  I  think  they're  going  to  open \n one  in  LA.  I  don't  know  if  that's  a \n leak.  Oops.  I \n went  the  last  time  I  think  I  was  in \n Korea.  Um,  they  also  have  them  in  Korea. \n I  went  and  I  got  one  and  I  just  started \n chatting  it  up  with  the  lady  who \n checked  it  out  or  whatever  and  she  was \n saying,  \"We're  going  to  open  one  in  LA.\" \n I  said,  \"Yes.\"  Do  you  know  the  Hungai \n guy?  Excuse  me.  Wait,  hold  on.  Are  you \n openminded?  My  iPhone.  You  know  my \n iPhone  case.  The  box.  The  Hungai  guy  is \n going  like  giga  viral.  You  give  it  to \n He's  so  funny.  But  I  wish  he  made  more \n content  out  of  character  cuz  I  I  can \n watch  that  all  day.  I  find  his  content \n really  I  agree.  Excuse  me.  You  want  put \n your  number  in  my  iPhone  16  Pro  Max. \n I  won  this.  Oh,  you  won  that?  Yeah.  Tell \n me.  Um,  well,  I  worked  um  It's  cute. \n Yeah.  Put  your  number  in  it.  What  color? \n It's  just  a  It's  just  a  You  can  open  it. \n Okay,  you  can  open  it.  Can  you  talk \n about  Japan  while  I  open  it?  Okay. \n Spends  $20,000  on  a  piano.  Can't  get  a \n new  phone.  Wait,  Lewis  money  though. \n Thanks,  Ledwig. \n Well,  speaking  of  Japan  from  like  five \n minutes  ago.  Oh,  yes.  We  should \n experience  Japan  from  the  comfort  of  our \n own  home.  Yes.  Since  our  trip  got \n cancelled,  instead  we'll  get  a  taste  of \n Japan,  quite  literally,  straight  to  our \n door. \n Sakuro.

I  love  Snack  Box  sponsors  cuz \n they  send  a  snack  box  and  I  get  to  eat \n all  the  yummy  snacks.  Hey,  there's  a \n pamphlet  you're  supposed  to  read. \n Hello.  Oh,  it's  so  cute.  I  would \n actually  get  this  before  going  to  Japan \n and  then  I'd  pick  out  all  the  things \n that  I  like  the  most  and  then  I  would  go \n and  eat  them  in  person,  too.  Oh  my  god, \n they  have  watermelon  gummies.  Do  you  see \n those?  The  photos  in \n here  are  painfully \n beautiful. \n Wow.  Oh,  guys,  this  is  one  of  my \n favorite  things  ever.  Matcha  Kit  Kat. \n Like,  you're  like,  can  a  Kit  Kat  get \n better?  The  answer  is  yes.  It's  this. \n Okay,  I'm  taste  testing  the  matcha  Kit \n Kat,  and  I  really  like  this  one  because \n I  think  I've  had  the  matcha  one  before, \n but  this  is  matcha  chocolate,  so  it  has \n a  bit  of  both,  which  I  think  is  probably \n perfect \n combination.  This  is \n fire.  This  is  so  [ __ ] \n good.  Can  we  swear?  This  is  our  podcast. \n We  can  do  what  we  want,  right?  Anyways, \n what  are  we  talking  about?  Slice  of \n life.  Let's  slice  of  life  it.  Okay, \n guys.  This  one's \n juicy.  Juicy.  Okay.  Greetings,  Pokey \n Lily.  That's  us.  That's  us. \n And  all  the  good  people  behind  the \n podcast.  That's  you  guys.  Yeah.  Thank \n you.  I'm  sending  this  after  I  just \n finished  watching  all  36  released \n episodes.  Wow.  Because  that's  how  long \n it  took  me  to  make  up  my  mind.  Wow.  I'm \n 22  and  met  my  first  love,  Amy,  at  the \n age  of  17.  Our  relationship  lasted  three \n and  a  half  years.  When  it  ended,  I  felt \n broken  because  I  had  to  learn  how  to  be \n myself  again.  A  my  ex  moved  in  with  a \n friend  who  had  a  we  had  in  common,  Luke, \n and  was  trying  to  get  better  through \n work.  She  moved  on  and  thankfully  I \n found  love  again.  A  a  few  months  after \n this  new  relationship,  I  received  a \n message  from  Jojo,  who  the  [ __ ]  is  that? \n Who  told  me  that  by  talking  with  Luke, \n he  learned  that  Amy  and  one  of  my \n brothers,  Po,  interesting  name,  had \n started  talking.  Huh?  and  they  ended  up \n having  on  multiple  occasions  before  she \n decided  to  cut  ties.  The  [ __ ]  After \n finding  out,  I  talked  with  Po.  That's \n exactly  what  I  was  going  to  ask.  And \n face  to  face.  He  assured  me  that  it  was \n a  lie.  T.  He  also  asked  me  for  Amy  and \n Luke's  number  to  clarify  things  with \n him.  I  spoke  with  Luke  a  few  days  later, \n who  was  still  defending  his  point,  but  I \n felt  something  strange  with  him  and \n decided  not  to  trust  him.  H  peculiar.  A \n week  later,  I  was  talking  with  Amy,  and \n during  our  call,  in  the  morning,  she \n confirmed  to  me  that  it  was  false  and \n talked  about  her  toxic  relationship  with \n Luke  and  the  fact  that  he  was  in  love \n with  her  to  justify  his  lie.  But  in  the \n evening,  she  cracked  and  sent  me  about \n 30  screenshots,  showing  to  me  that  it \n was  actually  the  truth  and  that  Po  was \n threatening  her  to  not  reveal  it.  I  was \n mad  and  asked  to  talk  again  with  Po.  I \n confronted  him,  and  this  time  it  was \n much  more  difficult.  He  stated  that \n everything  was  false,  that  the \n screenshots  were  fake,  that  it  was \n suspicious,  and  she  changed  her  mind, \n even  saying  that  she  must  have  a  mental \n condition  to  do  what  she  did.  It  was \n when  I  realized  that  the  situation  was \n really  driving  me  crazy.  One  of  them  was \n lying  to  me,  and  I  couldn't  figure  out \n who.  Oh  my  god,  you're  playing  Among  Us \n IRL.  So,  I  told  both  of  them  that  I \n could  no  longer  put  my  trust  in  them  and \n that  I  would  be  distancing  myself  from \n both  of  them.  Since  then,  I'm  not  sure \n if  I  made  the  right  decision.  What  would \n you  have  done  in  my  place? \n Bro,  this  is  one  of  the  most  Among  Us \n IRA.  What?  Wasabi. \n Wasabi.  Wasabi.  She  bit  into  a  wasabi \n chip.  She  didn't  know  it  was  wasabi \n chip.  But  she  would  have  if  she  read  the \n damn  pamphlet  and  if  she  used  code  sweet \n and  sour  when  she  checked  out.  Oh.  So, \n here's  what  I \n think.  Either  Amy  and  Luke  are  lying  to \n you  or  your  brother  is  lying  to  you, \n right?  He  knows  it's  one  or  the  other. \n He  doesn't  know  which.  No,  I  know.  I \n know.  So,  either  or.  Wait,  no.  I  I  think \n it's  either  Amy's  lying  or  Po  is  lying. \n Luke  is  kind  of  a  whatever  in  this \n aspect. \n Oh,  why  do  you  keep  eating  it?  It's \n actually  so  [ __ ]  good.  You  got  to  try \n these.  Like,  once  you  get  past  the \n wasabi,  it's  delicious, \n right? \n It's  so  good.  I  think  it's  my  favorite. \n Right.  You  like  it?  That's  so  good. \n Right.  So  good. \n But  it  hurts.  But  it's  really  good.  Wa. \n Anyway,  yeah.  One  of  them  is  lying  to \n you.  The  thing  is  like  in  a  world,  it's \n like  world  A  or  world  B,  but  in  a  world \n where  your  brother  isn't  lying  to  you, \n but  you  still  don't  trust  both  of  them \n and  you  cut  both  of  them  off.  Sucks.  You \n know  what  I  mean?  It's  like  your \n brother. \n So,  I  also  think  it's  unfortunate  if  I \n was  in  your \n shoes, \n I  couldn't  live  with  cutting  both  of \n them \n off  because  I  know  only  one  of  them  is \n lying  and  I  would  like  to  know  who  that \n is.  So,  I  would  really  treat  this  like \n an  Among  Us  game.  Okay.  You  know,  you \n have  certain  information  that's  pro  and \n con  each  person.  Right. \n Right.  But  there's  some  information  that \n I  feel  you  might  not  be  considering.  One \n of  these  people  you've  known  almost  your \n whole  life.  That  doesn't  mean  he's \n telling  the  truth.  I've  had  friends  of \n years  lie  to  me  in  video  games.  I'm \n sorry.  Years.  Anyways,  I  feel  like  you \n should  have  some \n hints  in  regards  to  their  personality \n traits,  their  mindset,  whether  either  of \n them  do  have  mental  conditions  because \n you  dated  one  of  them  and  you  have  known \n the  other  your  whole  life.  So,  I  feel \n like  if  you  poke  into  this  a  little  bit \n more,  I  think  you'll  be  able  to  decipher \n which  one  is  telling  the  truth.  But  like \n I  do  in  Among  Us  games,  your  best  bet  is \n actually  not  really  to  talk  to  them \n because  people  can  influence  and \n convince  us  easily.  We're  emotional \n creatures.  You  need  to  look  at  the  hard \n data,  the  facts.  Wait,  she  sent  you \n screenshots  where  he  was  and  she  she \n sent  30  screenshots,  but  your  brother  is \n saying  Wait,  isn't  that  the  hard  fact? \n She  faked  it.  She's  He's  saying  that \n everything's  false.  The  screenshots \n fake.  It's  suspicious  that  she  changed \n her  mind,  saying  that  she  must  have  a \n mental  condition  to  do  what  she  did. \n Honestly,  you  should  uh  try  to  see \n whether  you  can  decipher  whether  or  not \n the  screenshots  are  fake.  I  would  also \n rely  on  It's  not  easy  to  make  like  fake \n screenshots.  You  know  what?  Actually, \n just  ask  her  if  you  can  meet  up  and  if \n she  can  show  you  those  messages  on  her \n phone.  Boom.  Bing,  boom,  bam.  I  am \n selling  my  private  investigator  Sherlock \n Holmes  services.  Call  me  at  Sakura  Co \n with  code  sweet  and  sour. \n Oh,  thank  you  so  much,  dude.  Those  were \n so  good.  The  wasabi  chips.  For  some \n reason,  these  wasabi  chips  were  the \n best.  They  were  only  two.  I'm  sorry.  So \n good.  That  was  delicious.  Anyway,  guys, \n quick  call  to  action.  Please  send  us \n your  cringiest  stories  of  stuff  you  have \n done  in  the  past  or  that  has  happened  to \n you.
