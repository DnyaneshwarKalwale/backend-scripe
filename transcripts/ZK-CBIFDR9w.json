  "transcript": "this  is  me  in  2022  no  job  living  at  my \n parents  house  and  zero  LinkedIn \n followers  and  this  is  me  12  months  later \n featuring  involves  as  I  just  been  named \n one  of  the  fastest  growing  entrepreneurs \n on  the  platform  so  how  did  I  do  it  well \n in  this  video  I'm  going  to  break  down \n the  exact  seven  step  strategy  I  use  to \n go  from  zero  to  100,000  followers  in \n record  time  without  a  team  without  paid \n ads  and  without  any  previous  experience \n on  the  platform  and  to  prove  it  wasn't \n just  luck  I've  used  this  exact  same \n strategy  with  hundreds  of  clients  to \n help  them  grow  scale  and  monetize  the \n personal  Brands  too  let  me  explain  in \n its  most  simple  form  if  you  want  to  grow \n on  LinkedIn  you  first  need  to  do  a \n digital  detox  and  no  I  don't  mean \n locking  your  phone  away  fasting  and \n reading  50  bucks  but  more  about  removing \n what  no  longer  benefits  you  and  what  is \n rubbing  you  from  your  potential  success \n by  this  I  mean  removing  connections  on \n LinkedIn  all  bosses  classmate  or \n colleagues  anything  that  is  filling  your \n feet  with  irrelevant  noise  and \n self-comparison  that  is  preventing  you \n from  posting  consistently  I've  literally \n been  there  feeling  so  cringe  about \n posting  We  all  do  so  I  started  from  zero \n now  there's  two  ways  you  can  do  this  one \n removing  connections  and  unfollow  as \n many  people  as  possible  or  two  start \n from  zero  with  a  brand  new  account  I \n went  with  the  second  option  Clean  Slate \n new  new  start  and  no  old  work  friends \n peeping  at  what  I  was  up  to  I  had  no \n excuse  to  not  post  because  I  feared  of \n being  seen  trying  something  new  by  other \n people  and  I  had  all  the  reason  to  get \n out  there  and  look  for  the  right  people \n who  would  fit  into  my  the  side  Network \n CEOs  Founders  and  likeminded  people  I \n made  my  dream  100  list  a  term  coin  by \n Russell  Bronson  the  idea  is  that  you \n list  100  people  you'd  like  to  connect \n with  and  people  who  have  your  ideal \n people  in  their  networks  as  well  so  if \n you  wanted  to  connect  with  with  someone \n like  Steven  bartett  or  Simon  synic  for \n example  you  try  to  connect  with  their \n marketing  staff  or  co-founders  who  are \n more  likely  to  be  seeing  their \n connections  personally  increasing  your \n chances  of  reaching  them  in  the  long \n term  today  100%  of  my  connections  are  my \n dream  hundred  list  not  just  a  mix  of \n random  people  I'd  met  over  the  last  8 \n years  but  since  I  started  from  zero  I \n had  to  give  people  a  good  reason  to  even \n look  at  me  or  my  profile  and  I  had  to  do \n it  quickly  so  instead  of  sending  spammy \n into  the  DMS  100  times  a  day  saying  hi \n very  interested  in  what  you're  doing  at \n inside  company  let's  exchange  synergies \n I  identify  the  three  main  things  that \n would  make  anyone  else  notice  me  you \n should  focus  on  the  8020  rule  where  you \n prioritize  the  thing  with  the  highest \n impact  then  you  optimize  for  Speed  and \n not  Perfection  to  grow  as  fast  as \n possible  on  LinkedIn  from  zero  you  only \n need  three  things  to  start  first  the \n head  shot  it  needs  to  be  clear  and  high \n quality  you  need  to  look  approachable \n and  have  a  Sol  solid  background  or  at \n least  not  too  distracting  this  means  no \n photos  from  your  Spain  trip  with  your \n friends  or  an  outdated  selfie  you  took \n on  your  Android  10  years  ago  it  needs  to \n be  a  direct  representation  of  who  you \n are  but  most  importantly  the  person  that \n you're  trying  to  become  so  set  up  your \n iPhone  timer  with  a  clear  background  and \n take  a  bunch  of  up  close  photos  then \n drop  it  into  Cana  and  add  a  clear \n background  is  that  simple  you  can  even \n use  tools  like  seales  to  create  a  high \n quality  Prof  professional  photo  too  if \n you  can't  take  professional  photos  right \n now  secondly  your  headline  I've  covered \n this  before  so  I  leave  the  video \n somewhere  here  but  here  are  two  headline \n templates  you  can  use  immediately  right \n this  second  if  you  have  an  offer  you  can \n say  what  you  do  who  you  do  it  for  and \n how  you  help  so  for  example  I  help \n business  coaches  get  more  sales  through \n DM  now  if  you  don't  have  an  offer  you \n can  use  on  a  mission  to  do  cool  thing \n with  cool  outcome  sharing  content  and  in \n about  the  thing  about  your  journey  so \n for  example  on  a  mission  to  help \n entrepreneurs  grow  their  social  media \n sharing  content  about  marketing  and  Ai \n and  posting  about  the  journey  super \n simple  you  don't  need  to  over  complicate \n it  just  use  those  two  templates  to  start \n and  then  you  can  tweak  as  you  go  along \n before  we  move  on  to  the  third  you  need \n to  understand  that  your  profile  and \n headline  are  the  two  most  visible \n elements  about  your  profile  it's  showing \n in  your  profile  on  the  Main  feed  and  in \n your  comments  so  those  two  need  to  be \n great  but  don't  overthink  it  you  can \n always  go  back  and  tweak  it  like  I  said \n and  adjust  as  you  go  along  the  third  is \n your  banner  and  this  is  about  to \n contradict  like  99%  of  LinkedIn  advice \n and  even  mine  but  if  you  want  to  grow  as \n fast  as \n possible  just  pick  a  solid  color  that \n matches  your  brand  and  move  on  look  this \n is  the  B  I  had  from  Z  to  20,000 \n followers  and  this  is  the  B  that  I  had \n from  20  to  50,000  followers  I  still  use \n that  one  on  my  Twitter  look  a  dashing \n profile  with  cool  logos  an  optimized \n banner  and  Graphics  isn't  going  to  get \n you  seen  at  the  start  the  next  step  I'm \n about  to  show  you  well  it's  the  biggest \n investment  I  made  but  the  ROI  10x  is  for \n me  every  single  day  and  no  I  don't  mean \n cash  investment  I  was  an  unemployed \n entrepreneur  at  the  time  and  I  didn't \n have  too  much  money  to  invest  but  I  did \n have  one  thing  to  give  time  hacking \n growth  on  LinkedIn  is  a  pay-to-play  game \n and  you  have  two  currencies  money  and \n time  and  I  went  all  in  on  time \n investment  and  allocated  to  one  thing \n first  impressions  see  in  real  life  and \n online  first  impressions  are  insanely \n important  imagine  LinkedIn  as  the \n world's  largest  non-stop  business \n conference  you've  got  CEOs  investors \n industry  leaders  and  potential  clients \n all  on  the  One  Roof \n 247  now  with  steps  one  and  two  you're \n dressed  apart  but  not  many  people  know \n you  they  sure  they  know  me  so  how  do  you \n make  their  best  first  impression  one \n number  500  plus  that's  the  maximum \n number  of  connections  LinkedIn  will  show \n you  have  and  it's  the  one  thing  people \n look  at  to  see  where  they  can  trust  you \n one  thing  that  helps  is  mutual \n connections  there  is  a  massive  trust \n point  on  LinkedIn  and  it's  a  form  of \n social  proof  for  example  when  you  see \n two  videos  on  the  YouTube  comp  page  one \n of  them  has  your  favorite  entrepreneurs \n face  and  more  views  and  the  other  one \n doesn't  have  either  you're  more  likely \n to  click  on  the  video  that  has  more \n views  because  it's  more  interesting  to \n you  align  to  your  interest  and  it's \n validated  by  the  number  of  views \n subconsciously  you  think  that  the  video \n with  more  views  and  familiar  faces  is \n better  it  has  credibility  well  LinkedIn \n is  the  same  it's  one  of  those  undeniable \n LinkedIn  checkboxes  too  you  needed  to \n mark  your  profile  as  complete  to  get  500 \n plus  connections  you  don't  need  to  rush \n to  Post  100  pieces  of  content  a  day  but \n you  actually  need  to  rush  to  comment \n because  they  act  as  conversations  and \n people  on  LinkedIn  love  talking  about \n interesting  topics  it's  kind  of  one  of \n the  purposes  of  the  platform  too  so \n here's  how  to  get  500  plus  relevant \n connections  and  beyond  that  two  using \n commenting  first  find  20  to  30  active \n accounts  in  your  Niche  or  adjacent  ones \n so  if  it's  business  you  can  look  at \n marketing  entrepreneurship  and \n Leadership  accounts  make  sure  that  there \n is  a  range  of  following  from  0  to  5K \n then  5  to  20K  then  20K  plus  0  to  5K  is \n usually  people  in  the  same  boat  as  you \n and  most  likely  to  reciprocate  the \n interactions  5  to  20K  are  usually  steps \n ahead  and  and  they  may  reciprocate  but \n you  get  more  visibility  as  more  people \n follow  them  and  they  may  see  your \n comment  and  then  20,000  followers  plus \n maybe  harder  to  stand  out  but  if  you  do \n you  get  a  double  win  as  there  are  so \n many  more  eyeballs  on  you  just  look  at \n this  coming  with  nearly  200  likes  this \n got  him  like  three  leads  as  well  by  the \n way  so  list  their  name  URL  and  posting \n time  and  try  to  comment  as  early  as \n possible  on  their  post  the  earlier  you \n are  the  most  likely  people  are  to  know \n you  trust  me  I  did  this  for  months  and \n what  happened  was  that  due  to  the \n beautiful  nature  of  reciprocity  bias  the \n more  you  give  the  more  you  can  take  in \n the  end  when  it  comes  to  actually \n commenting  though  here's  exactly  what \n you  don't  do  you  don't  leave  great  post \n or  100%  ask  comments  you  don't  use  AI \n tools  to  comment  and  you  don't  use \n single  emergis  ass  comments  to  stand  out \n without  looking  like  a  fan  or  a  groupy \n you  need  to  leave  three  types  of \n comments  a  personal  take  on  what  the \n post  you're  commenting  on  was  about  a \n motivational  mic  drop  where  you  share  a \n quote  that  matches  the  tone  of  the  post \n or  if  you're  like  me  a  meme  use  your \n humor  you  can  gamify  this  as  well  doing \n commenting  Sprint  throughout  your  day \n that's  the  easiest  way  to  build  a  habit \n and  practice  your  commenting  you  can  use \n this  strategy  to  comment  on  people's \n content  in  your  feed  or  reply  to  your \n own  comments  on  your  own  post  this \n strategy  works  it's  even  being  featured \n by  link  LED  in  themselves  shout  out  to \n my  friend  Yasmin  Alec  for  creating  it  to \n me  commenting  is  the  biggest  way  to \n build  leverage  when  you  don't  have  any \n you're  guaranteed  thousands  of  new \n eyeballs  when  you  do  this  at  least  20 \n times  a  day  without  even  posting  you \n build  trust  connections  and  friendships \n just  through  commenting  alone  and  for \n all  the  technical  people  looking  to \n understand  why  this  is  important  if  you \n look  at  the  standard  marketing  funnel \n you  can  see  that  nurture  is  a  key  point \n for  long-term  success  your  LinkedIn  is \n the  same  you  nurture  your  orings  from \n awareness  level  to  consideration  and \n purchase  and  you  retain  them  by \n nurturing  them  to  stay  and  turning  them \n into  not  just  followers  but  a  true \n community  of  people  who  want  to  support \n your  mission  and  today  having  real \n conversations  is  what's  making  personal \n Brands  win  literally  no  one  comments  on \n your  post  no  one  likes  them  and  yes  it \n helps  to  get  people  into  your  door  but \n now  you  need  to  get  them  to  stay  I  for \n example  was  posting  a  variety  of  Life \n updates  marketing  Trends  memes  and \n fluffy  value  it  wasn't  getting  me  the \n virality  engagement  and  opportunities  I \n was  promised  so  I  did  the  complete \n opposite  I  focused  on  micro  niching  down \n my  first  Niche  on  LinkedIn  was  marketing \n good  enough  but  too  broad  because  in \n that  I  was  competing  with  SEO  influencer \n marketing  smas  copywriters  and  so  on  my \n content  was  scattered  then  I  learned \n about  the  single  biggest  business  hack \n to  grow  even  if  you  don't  have  any \n experience  it's  the  rule  of  one  one \n problem  one  solution  one  thing  I  spoke \n about  this  before  when  it  comes  to  offer \n creation  but  it's  insanely  important  in \n content  creation  too  so  to  find  the  one \n thing  you  need  find  the  topic  or  topics \n you're  best  at  for  me  it  was  personal \n branding  so  then  I  broke  down  what \n pastal  branding  actually  meant  to  me  and \n overall  it  was  a  combination  of  writing \n content  creation  PR  and  social  media \n strategy  I  narrow  it  down  to  my \n expertise  so  I  could  become  a  leader  in \n those  specific  micro  niches  quickly  so \n then  I  could  climb  on  lava  gaining  more \n Authority  more  leverage  and  way  more \n credibility  and  the  more  I  did  it \n because  of  the  nature  of  repetition  the \n better  I  got  here's  a  post  from  2  years \n ago  of  me  getting  double  and  triple \n likes  and  here's  a  post  from  this  week \n getting  over  1,000  likes  and  over  500 \n comments  this  wouldn't  have  been \n possible  though  if  I  didn't  force  myself \n to  post  content  and  followed  the  rule  of \n one  the  more  I  posted  the  more  feedback \n loops  I  created  through  data  and  the \n better  I  got  and  I  also  learned  a  ton \n more  through  experimentation  text  post \n carousels  infographics  hooks  re  hooks \n short  post  and  long  post  different  calls \n to  action  everything  became  a  test  and \n to  become  a  top  0.1  Creator  you  learn \n you  test  and  you  iterate  every  single \n day  this  to  me  is  truly  where  the  magic \n happens  because  it  feels  like  a  game \n find  the  gap  between  your  interest  and \n the  demand  and  again  if  you  speak  to  a \n broad  topic  like  entrepreneurship  or \n business  you're  competing  with  everyone \n gar  ve  borrow  business  meme  Pages  people \n with  100K  followers  but  if  you  speak \n about  an  insanely  Micron  Niche  thing \n like  conversion  on  LinkedIn  or  AI \n automations  for  B2B  then  you're  so  in \n you  don't  need  to  change  your  Niche \n entirely  but  you  do  need  to  Niche  down \n to  where  your  expertise  truly  lies  that \n needs  and  I  can't  emphasize  enough  to  be \n your  main  focus  with  your  content  don't \n over  complicated  it  you  don't  need  more \n systems  you  need  more  focus  on  your \n content  when  in  doubt  think  about  the \n rule  of  one  so  just  before  we  move  on  to \n the  fifth  step  in  this  strategy  I've \n created  an  entirely  free  course  on \n personal  branding  and  how  to  grow  an \n online  audience  fast  through  writing \n Link  in  the  description  oh  and  also \n don't  forget  to  subscribe  to  this \n channel  so  I  can  keep  on  providing  you \n with  free  value  and  resources  like  this \n one  now  we've  hits  a  light  bulb  moment \n but  to  grow  in  LinkedIn  you  need  to \n understand  how  high  performance  content \n is  born  and  it  all  comes  down  to  three \n things  educate  Inspire  and  entertain  if \n you  look  across  the  board  for  recent \n long  form  and  short  form  content  you've \n liked  they  all  do  one  of  those  three \n things  Justin  Welsh  educates  heavily \n online  Mr  the  Beast  entertains  to  a  mass \n scale  and  people  like  David  gorgens \n Inspire  if  your  content  isn't  doing  at \n least  one  of  them  then  you  won't  grow \n and  after  studying  thousands  of  accounts \n in  a  variety  of  Industries  I  noticed \n that  those  who  do  at  least  two  of  them \n win  the  educational  content  brings  them \n in  the  inspirational  content  makes  them \n stay  and  the  entertainment  element  makes \n them  love  you  but  before  anyone  proposes \n to  you  you  need  to  nail  the  fast  two \n educational  and  inspirational  content \n for  the  next  90  days  your  focus  should \n be  posting  3  to  five  times  a  week  80% \n educational  content  and  20% \n inspirational  content  and  all  of  it \n needs  to  link  back  to  your  pillars  we \n talked  about  on  step  five  to  educate  you \n need  to  be  given  tactical  advice  for \n example  this  post  breaks  down  LinkedIn \n using  listicles  and  examples  concisely \n Post  Number  Two  does  the  exact  same \n thing  but  leveraging  carousels  and \n examples  to  inspire  you  need  to  be \n sharing  your  story  in  this  post  I  shared \n an  incredibly  personal  story  about  my \n dad  but  it  linked  back  to \n entrepreneurship  and  how  I  got  started \n this  post  takes  us  through  an  entire \n journey  in  less  than  60  seconds  and  this \n post  breaks  up  belief  and  tells  us  the \n story  immediately  the  big  Nuance  here  is \n that  it  all  needs  to  link  back  to  your \n main  expertise  and  why  the  story  was \n relevant  so  if  you're  in  B2B  sales \n talking  about  your  engagement  in  what \n you  learned  isn't  what  you  want  to  be \n doing  although  it  is  a  very  lengthen \n thing  to  do  and  I  am  honestly  all  here \n for  it  but  if  you  are  in  B2B  sales  and \n you  just  got  engaged  and  your  new  fiance \n set  front  row  after  you  practice  your \n speech  20  times  in  front  of  her  and  your \n post  talks  about  having  a  life  partner \n who  makes  the  world  of  a  difference  in \n your  career  then  there's  potential \n because  it  links  your  personal  life  and \n your  professional  life  just  don't  overdo \n it  with  the  Emojis  okay  now  being \n serious  a  good  tip  here  is  to  leverage \n visual  content  while  doing  this  good \n written  content  is  the  vehicle  but  you \n can  also  grow  quicker  by  using  visual \n elements  this  can  be  in  the  form  of \n infographics  carousels  Twitter \n screenshots  or  nicely  designed  graphics \n and  a  bonus  step  to  anyone  who  made  it \n this  far  into  the  video  if  you  look  at \n the  examples  I  showed  you  there  is  one \n thing  they  all  have  in  common  visual \n Rhythm  or  good  text  formatting  with  skim \n more  than  we  read  and  creating  visual \n harmony  with  your  writing  can  improve \n your  chances  of  getting  more  engagement \n in  growing  your  brand  and  credibility  as \n it  puts  emphasis  on  your  ability  to \n explain  things  in  a  clear  and  concise \n way  as  a  good  rule  of  thumb  of  Mind \n always  try  to  make  your  sentences  8  to \n 10  words  Max  use  bullet  points  rather \n than  a  dragged  out  long  ass  paragraph \n and  always  optimized  for  mobile  these \n personally  are  the  best  tools  as  the \n market  has  shift  to  heavily  visual \n content  due  to  the  Tik  toic  of  social \n media  notice  how  I  didn't  say  video \n content  though  but  that's  an  Easter  egg \n for  another  day  or  you  can  follow  me  on \n LinkedIn  or  X  where  I'm  always  dropping \n updates  Trends  and  my  unpopular  opinions \n now  the  thing  that  ties  this  entire \n strategy  together  is  this  final  point \n point  and  you  might  have  heard  the \n saying  if  you  want  to  go  fast  go  alone \n but  if  you  want  to  go  far  go  together \n social  media  including  LinkedIn  is \n rooted  in  one  thing  connection  it's \n truly  how  you  stand  out  from  everyone \n who  doesn't  care  enough  people  repeat \n the  same  cycle  of  creating  content \n posting  and  then  forgetting  to  build  the \n one  thing  that  is  going  to  keep  on \n pushing  them  up  their  Network  when  I \n started  on  LinkedIn  I  had  zero \n connections  and  I  don't  mean  just \n literally  asking  just  LinkedIn \n connections  but  I  knew  no  one  in  the \n industry  so  to  build  from  the  ground  up \n I  committed  to  have  as  many  coffee  chats \n and  zoom  calls  as  possible  for  months \n and  I  mean  months  my  calendar  was  packed \n with  50-minute  coffee  chats  with  people \n who  were  just  starting  out  just  like  me \n or  people  two  steps  in  front  of  me  and \n people  two  steps  behind  me  and \n eventually  I  reached  those  miles  ahead \n and  in  fact  it's  actually  how  I  met  my \n fast  Mentor  Richard  Mo  I  connected  with \n someone  via  their  comment  section  that \n someone  then  liked  my  post  and  my  now \n Mentor  saw  the  post  connected  with  me  on \n LinkedIn  when  I  had  like  1,000  followers \n I  asked  for  a  coffee  chat  and  he  accept \n it  and  now  he's  helped  me  understand  how \n to  price  my  services  build  my  offer \n close  thousands  in  sales  positioning  and \n endless  ways  to  skip  the  line  learning \n from  him  if  you  want  to  replicate  that \n follow  steps  1  to  six  in  this  video  to \n attract  like-minded  people  and  stand  out \n give  value  in  every  new  conversation  you \n have  you  can  offer  to  help  someone  out \n or  solve  a  problem  for  them  become  an \n asset  for  people  build  personal  leverage \n slowly  your  efforts  will  compound  and \n you  will  become  a  magnet  you  can  also \n collaborate  with  people  or  start  getting \n referrals  and  with  time  you  also  make \n friends  in  your  industry  crazy  huh  over \n time  I  got  invited  to  iners  events  which \n made  connections  even  more  meaningful \n and  this  is  truly  how  I  built  my  own \n luck  by  showing  up  every  single  day  now \n my  friends  this  is  exactly  how  to  grow \n your  audience  as  fast  as  possible  now  if \n you  want  to  make  leads  through  it  I \n check  out  this  video  too  I'll  see  you \n there",
