  "transcript": "We're going on some of the most\nexpensive dates in the world. Like this $500,000 date that includes the\nentirety of Disneyland, all for ourselves… a $100,000 date at this mega complex with\na massive waterpark and indoor ski resort… a $50,000 private island date… Best date ever! a $10,000 date cooked by Gordon Ramsay… and we even convinced\nsuperstar singer Madison Beer to go on a date with\nmy most awkward friend. All starting with this $1 date:\na Ferris Wheel! - Here's $1.\n- Ok. - Ladies first.\n- Thank you. Take notes, men. Is this safe? I see why it's only $1.\nThe $1 date has now begun. It's, uh, making a lot of noise. Why is it making that noise? It's just the wind, right? I usually film 20, 25 days a month, and I don't really get to\nspend much time with my fiancee, so I literally picked this video so me and\nmy fiancee could spend more time together. I love you, even if you\ndidn't take me to Disneyland. Well… not yet. But for the final date in this video,\nfor the first time in history, Disney reserved\nthe whole park just for us. That's it for the $1 date! Let's head out to the $10,000 dinner date—\nAfter you, babe. Turn off the park.\nI'll see you guys there. And now, the $10,000 date where we're gonna be recreating\nour first-ever date with sushi. - After you.\n- Thank you. She doesn't know this, but Gordon Ramsay's\ngonna be making us the meal for this date. Thank you. There you go.\nYou look really cute. I picked this just for you. It's been a long time since my first date\nwith Thea, and now that we're engaged, I'm really excited to explore the world's\nmost expensive dates with my fiancee. You're probably wondering,\n\"Why is this the $10,000 date?\" Why is it? Gordon Ramsay himself\nis gonna be cooking our meals. The Gordon Ramsay? Yep. Come on in. Welcome to Lucky Cat Miami! It's nice meeting you! How's it going? What an amazing night\nthis is gonna be. Oh, I'm excited. Yes. We're gonna kick off with some pea\nguacamole with some delicious crackers. Did you say peacock? I said pea guac! Oh, pea guac, oh… Not peacock, babe. To celebrate this $10,000 dinner,\nsome seriously exclusive sushi. Ladies first. Cheers. Yeah, this is good. We have a delicious gourmet fried chicken,\nwonderful fried rice, and duck bao buns. Duck tacos? Bao buns! Duck tacos. Bao buns! You can yell at me. I will do in a minute.\nYou're pushin' my limits, man. Enjoy. I want you to take the first bite. I knew you were gonna do that. It's only the $10,000 date, and we already have the world's best chef\ncooking a romantic dinner for the 2 of us. Nothing could possibly\nruin this moment. Chef. What are you guys\ndoin' here? No, no no, no. - I got you.\n- Come on, man! Don't rip it! I'm not ripping it, chef!\nI'm not ripping it! Oh my goodness, mate. Why are you disrespecting\nhis restaurant? This is supposed to be\na romantic dinner! Nolan, mine's burning. That's it.\nI'm done! What are you? An idiot sandwich! That is worth 10K alone. You guys have turned it\nto a nightmare! For $10,000, Gordon had a romantic\nsurprise for our final course. This is nice!\nThis is romantic! This is actually\nvery romantic. Aww. Thank you. This 10K date was amazing. I can't imagine how insane these dates\nare gonna get later in the video. The $50,000 date is this\nentire private island, so me and Thea brought some friends with\nus to make this a quadruple date. Wait, what?\nWhat is that? This is Tom,\nthe turkey. Please tell me we're\nnot eating Tom. We are not eating Tom. I didn't know if this was like a\nSay-Hi-To-Your-Dinner thing as you arrive. We have this entire $50,000 island\nand everything on it to ourselves. I say the best way to kick off\nan island date is to go jet skiing! Let's go! Best date ever! You might recognize Grizz and Hase from the video where they spent 74 days in\nthe wilderness together. The day I took that hood off and saw you\nwas the best day of my life! And you saw these two when Josh spent\n22 days in solitary confinement. These three spent weeks away\nfrom their wives, so I thought I'd give them\nsome quality time together. This is the best date\nwe've ever been on! Does the wife approve? I approve! This is how I make good with\nall the people I put in prolonged places. Oh my gosh,\nthat was so close! Hey, Jimmy! It’s Nolan! Yo! Uh-oh,\nwe're bouncin'. Nolan is flying solo for this date, but later on, he'll be going on\na date with Madison Beer. I, uh—\nthe great outfit… Everyone, the island is all yours.\nGo do whatever you want! So we all enjoyed the luxuries of\nthis $50,000 island date. All right everyone,\nheads up! Like hitting golf balls that are also\nfish food right into the ocean. - Thea, you show me how it’s done.\n- I actually don't know how to do this. Now we're getting couples' massages\non the beach. There is just a person on my back.\nVery relaxing. Grizz and Hase were playing\nsome beach volleyball… against their wives, of course. And Josh and Kenna were having\na picnic on the beach. I forgive you for taking him away\nfrom me for so long. - Welcome in, guys.\n- Oh wait, there's rose petals. I mean, I laid those\njust for you. For 50 grand, we all get these\nluxurious bungalows. Where do the petals lead? I mean, look where\nthe petals lead. Into the lovely master suite. I made a heart just for you. It is so pretty.\nAnd you picked them yourself? - Oh, I made this myself.\n- Wow. And as the sun was setting on\nthis $50,000 date… To our loved one! Cheers! …Nolan was the only one\nat dinner without a date. Until Tom the turkey showed up. Nolan, we found you a partner! Uh, I'm all good on Tom. And after dinner,\nwe did some couples dancing. Rate our dance move. Again. Got it? Come on! And after dark, we had a beach campfire,\nand I had a surprise for everyone. Cue the fireworks show! And lightning at the same time! - Nolan, your date showed up!\n- Tom the Turkey! Yo, why are you standin' so still? That's it for the $50,000 date!\nI'll see you guys at the next one. For double the cost of\nthe previous date, we get this massive indoor metropolis\nall to ourselves. There's a giant theme park, the largest indoor\nwater park in America, even its own\nweather control system so they can have the largest indoor\nski slope in America. Ooh, it's so cool. This is terrifying! And while Thea loves skiing… I haven't told her… I have no idea how to ski. Babe, this is massive! You're scared?\nDon’t be scared. I'm not scared. Nah. You're good. Hey, what's over there? - What?\n- I'm freakin' terrified. - What did you say?\n- I'm excited! Ok, you got it? Babe, grab the straight— Babe, stop! How do I stop? Babe, I'm starting to think\nthat you don't know how to ski. No, I—\nI know how to ski. - How do I stand up?\n- I got you. Ah! Oh, no. Babe, stop! Babe, help! Thea, make me stop. Ok. I got you. How do I stop? Legs together! Legs closed, legs closed! What, are they not closed? Yeah, skiing is so much fun. Anyways, let's move on with the date! With so much to explore in\nthis shopping metropolis, it felt like doing ten dates in one! From winning prizes in an arcade… …getting a hole-in-one\nin mini golf… - Look at that!\n- Yeah! …or building each other\ncustom teddy bears. I love it. And where I normally do these kinds of\nvideos by myself or with my friends, doing this with the person I love most\nwas kind of magical. Being able to do pretty much anything\nyou could ever want to do on a date— It felt like being a kid in a candy store\n…literally! Ooh, chocolate. Whoa. What is this? Uh. Hey, ma'am?\nWhat is this? They're Hershey's. Can we replace these with Feastables? Sure. Ok. Oh! Much better! If you haven’t already,\ntry Feastables. It's the best-tasting chocolate\non the planet. Let's keep the date going. We now have an entire waterpark\nto ourselves, and we just wanna take\na relaxing swim together. Isn't it crazy that we're\nin the middle of a mall? It's like as big as the ocean. Up next, we actually got Madison Beer to\ngo on a date with Nolan. Do you think Nolan has a chance with her? We're about to find out. For the $250,000 date,\nMadison Beer, the two-time Grammy nominee,\nplatinum-selling artist, with over 3.5 billion streams worldwide, is going on a date with… my awkward friend Nolan. - Hello!\n- Hey. - Great to meet you.\n- How are you? Nice to meet you. And while Nolan is on his date with\nMadison Beer, me and Tareq are currently\ntucked away in the bathroom with a walkie that communicates\ndirectly to a mic in Nolan's ear. Where are you from? - I'm from Long Island.\n- New York? Yes. Where are you from? Nebraska. Not much\nout there besides corn. - Cool.\n- Yeah. No, he's talking about corn! In this seven years I've known Nolan,\nI have never seen him this nervous before. So to help Nolan out, I spent $250,000\non Madison's dream date. From driving her favorite car,\ngetting VIP treatment at an MLB game, and an over-the-top sushi dinner, all to give Nolan the best shot of\nsecuring a second date. Tell her you like her outfit. A great outfit. Thank you. We told the waiter to help us\nwingman Nolan. I'll be your server.\nWelcome to Bar Siesta. You guys look amazing.\nI like your shoes my man. Dude, thank you. But it was quickly clear\nthat it wasn't working. How's the weather? How's the weather? Cool. He’s falling apart. Nolan is not used to talking\nto attractive women. - You've watched the videos before?\n- I watch all the videos. What's your favorite video? The one where they were underground\nfor 100 days. Madison Beer watches our videos. I never expected that. Same. I don't really eat meat. Vegan?\nVegetarian? Pescatarian,\n'cause I love sushi. They're getting to know each other,\nthis is nice. - Sorry, I just got lost in your eyes.\n- Aw, that's so sweet. Ohh, he hit it! He took the shot! I was staring into the abyss.\nI don't… - Oh, not my eyes?\n- No. As they finished eating,\nI had one last idea to help Nolan. I want you to tip the waiter $10,000.\nMy card is in your wallet. That guy was so nice.\nI think we should tip $10,000. I would love nothing more. - Nolan has a gift for you.\n- We left a little something for you. Wait, are you guys serious? - Thank you.\n- I appreciate it. - Here are the keys.\n- Thank you. Let's hit it. Madison really loves animals, so their\nnext stop on their date is an animal farm. Nolan's only problem now was that\nthe petting zoo was an hour drive away. Me and Tareq are still listening in. What's it like going up in front of\nthousands and thousands of people? I just love my fans. They're the reason I get to do\nstuff like this and live my dreams. He's warming up and\nhe's getting better with time. We made it to the second part of the date. The Gentle Barn, a sanctuary that\nrescues abused animals. What made you start loving\nanimals so much? I have a lot of anxiety, and I feel like\nthey just are a calming reminder of peace. I feel a sense of calm around you. You are smooth with it. But visiting animals wasn't the only thing\non our agenda. They're gonna give you guys $25,000, and I'm actually going to match them,\nand I’m gonna give you another 25,000. And then it was time for me to ask\nan important question. You two ready to head to\nan Angels baseball game? - Let's do it.\n- Sure am. Do you mind if me and my fiancee join you\nguys for the next part of the date? Am I allowed to say no? No, 'cause I paid for it. I mean, you paid for it, right? And then we had an entire suite to\nourselves at an Angels game. This view of the game is insane. We got custom jerseys with\nour names on the back. And after almost all of us\nmade it on the jumbotron… a crowd began forming around us. You'll be in a video, say \"Hi.\" Anyways, we should probably head to\nthe next part of this date. And for the final part of\nthe $250,000 date— What are we\ndoing, Nolan? Sushi dinner and an ice skating rink with\nsome of the best sushi chefs on the earth. I can definitely say I've never\ndone anything like this. I gotcha, I gotcha. Thank you, Jimmy. Tonight we prepared for you all\na tasting menu. How much does this\namount of fish cost? A couple thousand. How do you think we got up to\nthe 250K price tag? Definitely looks like\nmy type of bite of sushi. Oh my God. - That is so good.\n- Wow. And then we all enjoyed some of the best\nsushi I've ever had in my entire life. This is the best date ever. - Thanks, Nolan.\n- Anytime. The 250K date, I think we could all agree,\nwas a lot of fun. Nolan, you had a question\nyou wanted to ask. I do. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. My shoe was just untied. Would you like to go on a second date to\nDisneyland with me? Yes. Let's head on over! And now it is time for the most expensive\ngrand finale date. We have Disneyland all to ourselves! This is gonna be awesome.\nLet's go ride some rides! Disney won't just hand over\ntheir keys to anyone, but for this once-in-a-lifetime date, we were given the entire park\nfor one night. And with so much to do,\nwe had to bring the boys, our friends from the island,\nand of course… Madison and Nolan. Yo, once we’re at the top,\nthis is gonna have a crazy view. But our first stop is this\nabsolutely insane Star Wars ride. All right, that's cool. Holy smokes!\nLook how big this is! Normally, people can wait\nhours for this ride, but my friends and I walked right in. Yo, strap in. All right, who's ready for\nthe Star Wars ride? Is now a bad time to mention\nI haven't seen the movies? What? This is crazy!\nHow did Disney build all this? This is wild. Oh my Gosh. Nolan, protect Madison! Yo, can you believe we're\ndoing this right now? Yeah, this is insane! - That was awesome.\n- Once in a lifetime! This is crazy! That was amazing! Every other cart was empty.\nWe have this whole place to ourselves. Disneyland is awesome! That was sick! And after that ride,\nwhat could be cooler… …than building your own lightsaber? Oh, yeah!\nCoolest lightsaber! Up next, we're all gonna ride\nthis giant Ferris Wheel. We're back to where\nthis video started. You could say it went full circle. I've never been on a Ferris Wheel\nthat looks like that! Yeah, this is massive! It feels like we're stepping into\nan old movie. Come on in, babe. This is like the $1 date,\nbut in Disneyland and much bigger. Much bigger! You can see the entire\npark up here. Wow! How does this compare to\nour $1 date? I mean, it's so much better. It's very romantic here in Disney. Wonder what Nolan and\nMadison are doing. Fist bump. Let's go. Things are not looking good for\nNolan right now. I can't wait to\nplay games. Yeah, that sounds fun. - Are you gonna win me something?\n- Of course. Yay! Are you gonna win me something? Oh, you betcha! Let's go! With his eye on the prize,\nNolan challenged me and Chandler to a friendly competition. This is what you're\ncompeting for. - A worm? Babe, do you want that worm?\n- Yes, I really want it. Ok, boys, I'm gonna\nhave to win this one. - All right, I wanna win this for you.\n- Please. 3, 2, 1… Go! - Nolan!\n- First one, first one. Let's go! It's, like, curving. Two! That's two! You need three to win. This is the grand prize.\nIt's all yours. For you. You can feel the tension in\nthe air right now. Gah, come here! But you know I couldn't lose to\nNolan like that. Yes! Yes! Oh my goodness! Let's run it back! Yes! - Yay!\n- Here y’go, babe. The Three P.\nHere we go! We won again! That was fun! It's fun winning. There are no words to describe how special\nit is to have Disneyland all to ourselves. And I think we all made memories\nthat are gonna last a lifetime. Whoa, babe.\nThere's a puddle. You're a gentleman! No wet feet for you. Take notes, boys. And to wrap things up,\nwe have one final surprise. We're gonna be eating dinner in\nfront of the Disney castle. - Oh my!\n- What? All right, I don't know why Disney's going\nall out for us, but thank you guys. - Oh my gosh.\n- Wow! - This is crazy.\n-This is beautiful! Everyone, come on, sit down. Cheers to the greatest date in history. Cheers! Yes! This was an awesome night.\nI'm glad I can enjoy it with all of you. Cheers! Of all the dates I took you on,\nwhich one was your favorite? Definitely this one. Yeah? Yeah, ‘cause everybody's here.\nWe should do this more! Rent all of Disneyland? Yeah. That was awesome. And to wrap up the video,\nfor the first time in Disney's history, they're going to do a private parade\nfor all of us. Let's head on over. I gotta say, this date is gonna be\nso hard to top. Huge thanks to Disney for absolutely\nblowing our minds with this experience. This was truly a once in a lifetime. If you don't have notifications on,\nmake sure you turn ‘em on so you don't ever miss a video. Chandler— Subscribe!",
