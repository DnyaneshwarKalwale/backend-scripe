  "transcript": "this  is  me  in  2022  I  was  struggling  to \n sign  clients  I  was  spending  all  my  days \n on  boring  tasks  and  basically  I  was  a \n business  owner  in  a  red  ocean  of  other \n businesses  and  this  is  me  in  2025  I  have \n over  150,000  followers  online  I  get \n inbound  leads  and  sales  every  day  and \n I'm  recognized  as  an  expert  in  my \n industry  on  Forbes  and  on  the  favicon \n ranking  and  in  this  video  I'm  going  to \n explain  exactly  what  happened  between \n 2022  and  2025  and  how  I  went  from  a \n random  business  owner  to  an  authority  in \n my  industry  thanks  to  a  specific \n framework  that  I've  ideated  along  the \n way  so  first  let's  get  back  to  December \n 2021  as  I  said  I  was  a  business  owner \n but  in  a  red  ocean  of  other  business \n owners  that  were  exactly  like  me  I \n didn't  have  a  personal  brand  no  one  knew \n me  at  this  time  I  had  no  Authority  in  my \n industry  I  was  not  recognized  as  an \n expert  and  no  one  was  listening  to  me  I \n was  not  getting  any  inbound  leads  so \n what  I  had  to  do  was  to  chase  clients \n with  outbound  emails  and  direct  messages \n but  I  had  a  poor  reply  rate  because \n people  didn't  know  me  so  they  didn't \n want  to  open  my  messages  and  reply  and \n to  tell  you  the  truth  I  was  afraid  to \n share  my  expertise  publicly  but  in \n January  2022  everything  changed  because \n of  one  decision  I  decided  to  start \n publishing  in  content  on  LinkedIn  here \n is  what  happened  exactly  one  of  my \n colleague  was  already  publishing  content \n on  LinkedIn  and  he  told  me  hey  you \n should  have  a  look  and  try  to  just \n experiment  some  posts  on  LinkedIn  and \n see  what  happens  so  I  didn't  do  anything \n fancy  at  the  beginning  I  was  just \n publishing  text  posts  so  I  was  sharing \n my  opinions  and  my  thoughts  on  my \n industry  but  to  be  honest  I  was  just \n randomly  posting  at  the  beginning  to \n test  many  different  formats  and  type  of \n posts  so  this  this  is  exactly  when  my \n life  as  a  business  owner  started  to \n change  and  then  I  kept  posting  for  days \n for  weeks  and  then  for  months  and \n eventually  for  years  and  here  we  are  in \n 2025  I've  been  posting  every  day  since \n January  2022  and  this  totally \n transformed  my  business  and  along  the \n way  I've  ideated  a  framework  that  I  call \n the  authority  first  framework  that  helps \n me  to  position  my  brand  and  my  personal \n brand  as  a  go-to  expert  in  my  industry \n and  this  is  exactly  what  you  should  do \n as  well  if  you  want  to  grow  your \n Authority  in  your  industry  so  this \n framework  is  all  about  building \n authority  with  content  because  your  goal \n is  not  to  become  a  pop  star  on  social \n media  or  to  have  a  very  large  following \n with  a  lot  of  different  people  what  you \n need  to  do  is  to  attract  your  buyers  by \n showing  your  expertise  in  content  so \n here  is  how  it  works  exactly  first  you \n need  to  focus  on  a  positioning  so  in  the \n past  year  I  decided  to  focus  my \n positioning  on  B2B  content  for  B2B \n businesses  then  you  need  to  go  deeper \n into  your  expertise  to  find  the  unique \n insights  and  knowledge  that  you  have  and \n that  your  competitors  don't  have  it  can \n come  from  your  skills  from  your  industry \n knowledge  or  it  can  come  from  learnings \n that  you  got  from  all  the  work  that \n you've  conducted  across  the  years  what \n is  important  is  that  is  related  to  your \n expertise  to  your  industry  and  that  it's \n Unique  we  this  kind  of  insights  you  will \n be  able  to  create  unique  content  and \n then  of  course  the  goal  is  to  publish \n this  expert  content  on  a  social  media \n channel  so  you  have  the  choice  between \n Instagram  X  and  Linkedin  for  example  so \n I  chose  LinkedIn  in  January  2022  as  I \n said  and  I  never  stopped  and  I  believe \n it's  really  the  best  channel  to  build \n Authority  in  your  industry  and  to  grow \n your  brand  and  your  personal  brand  so \n what  happens  when  you  publish  content  on \n a  Channel  people  will  start  perceiving \n you  as  an  industry  expert  because  step \n by  step  they  read  your  content  discover \n your  point  of  view  and  discover  what  you \n mean  in  your  content  and  of  course  you \n cannot  build  this  position  on  the  market \n within  a  few  days  you  need  to  keep  going \n and  this  is  why  consistency  and \n discipline  is  very  important  now  what \n happens  after  is  really  magic  because  as \n I  said  before  I  had  to  chase  clients  by \n sending  emails  DMS  or  even  calling  them \n but  now  thanks  to  this  position  I  can \n attract  buyers  to  me  and  this  is  exactly \n what  you  will  get  if  you  keep  on \n publishing  expertise  and  Authority \n content  and  then  people  will  buy  from \n you  because  they  perceive  you  as  the \n expert  compared  to  your  competitors  that \n are  not  sharing  content  and  that  are  not \n proving  their  expertise  and  if  your \n competitors  are  sharing  content  this  is \n even  a  better  reason  to  publish  content \n yourself  because  they  have  more  chance \n to  win  the  deals  if  they  are  publishing \n content  and  you're  not  so  basically  the \n authority  first  framework  is  a \n combination  of  your  expertise  of  a \n specific  mindset  and  of  a  Content \n strategy  that  help  you  position  yourself \n as  the  goto  expert  so  people  start \n noticing  you  they  start  associating  your \n name  with  the  expertise  and  they  start \n buying  from  you  rather  than  your \n competitors  if  you  interested  to  know \n more  about  the  authority  first  framework \n you  can  have  a  look  at  the  link  inside \n the  description  which  is  my  course  about \n the  authority  first  framework  to  help \n you  deep  dive  and  create  the  content \n strategy  that  you  deserve  to  become  an \n authority  in  your  industry  and  attract \n buyers  now  some  people  come  to  me  and \n say  hey  but  can  I  not  just  use  the  tofu \n mofu  Buu  framework  and  this  is  the  graph \n that  I  show  them  you  see  here  the  expert \n has  a  simple  strategy  which  is  to  show \n their  expertise  in  order  to  position \n themselves  so  this  is  my  story  and  how  I \n went  from  a  random  business  owner  to  an \n authority  in  my  industry  you  can  apply \n the  exact  same  framework  to  do  the  same \n for  your  business  as  a  summary  here  is \n what  you  will  have  to  do  you  will  have \n to  choose  a  unique  positioning  you  will \n have  to  Deep  dive  into  your  expertise  to \n find  unique  insights  then  you  will  have \n to  start  publishing  on  one  channel  and \n of  course  you  need  to  keep  posting  on \n this  channel  you  need  to  be  consistent \n and  have  discipline  and  then  step  by \n step  month  by  month  you  will  build  a \n positioning  in  your  industry  and  you \n will  start  attracting  buyers  so  I \n believe  you  can  apply  this  framework  and \n you  can  actually  become  an  authority  in \n your  industry  with  content",
