Today  Harry  will  be  hiding  in \n the  city  of  London  and  being  hunted  down \n by  teams  of  YouTubers  from  our  starting \n point  at  Four  Seasons  Tower  Bridge. \n However,  once  YouTubers  find  him  must \n hide  with  Harry  until  eventually  there's \n only  one  team  of  losers  left.  And  I  also \n have  some  things  prepared  to  make  sure \n their  search  is  a  living  hell.  It's  your \n job  to  find  me. \n Okay,  my  first  port  call  is  going  to  be \n up  Monument.  I  believe  you  can  climb  it \n and  it  will  give  you  a  good  vantage \n point  of  the  city  and  then  I  can  uh \n well,  I'll  try  and  figure  out  where  I'm \n going  to  hide  because  there's  a  lot  of \n people  looking  for  me  today.  Can  I  hide \n on  your  bus,  sir?  Now,  to  decide  the \n order  in  which  teams  go  out  and  find \n Harry,  I  have  created  some  simple  games. \n Game  one,  the  one  envelope.  Envelope \n envelope.  Each  team  picks  an  envelope \n and  one  envelope  says  you  are  going \n first.  So,  pick  one.  Pick.  Which  one  you \n want?  Which  one?  Go  pick.  Pick  one.  Why \n not  pick  one?  Uh,  this  one.  The  golden. \n The  golden  one.  Not  even  the  golden  one. \n I  want  you  to  know  if  I  was  allowed  in \n buildings  up  there  would  be  perfect. \n It's  like  a  whole  sky  garden.  Alas,  I'm \n I'm  stuck  outside.  Go.  What  does  it \n say?  It  says  nothing.  Next.  Three,  two, \n one.  Nothing.  Three,  two,  one.  Nothing. \n Nothing. \n Yes. \n [Applause] \n Come  on,  Randy  Green.  We  need  to  go.  I \n feel  somewhat  dodgy  hiding  in  a  church \n ground.  I  don't know  why.  It's  a  little \n bit  disrespectful.  I  don't  I  don't \n really  know,  but  not  going  to  do  it. \n Right.  Is  it  up  here? \n Where  am  I  going?  Which  way  did  Harry \n go?  Just  go  in  your  car.  Go  in  my  car. \n Just  drive  around.  Did  Harry  get  in  a \n car?  I  reckon  he  had  a  car  ready  and \n waiting.  Yeah.  Ready?  Yeah.  to  get  far \n like  as  far  away  as  possible.  He's  not  a \n car.  He's  not  a  car  guy.  So,  I'm \n thinking  the  top  of  there  and  then  but \n by  the  time  people  see  me,  hopefully  I \n can  clock  they  see  me  and  escape  down  it \n and  send  them  on  like  a  wild  goose \n chase.  That's  my  dream  here. \n Game  two.  Uh  been  there.  Found  that. \n Under  one  of  these  baked  beans  tins  is  a \n sticker.  Okay.  If  you  get  the  sticker, \n you're  going  next.  Come  on.  Someone  go \n on  Toby.  Come  on.  Go  on.  Maybe \n nothing.  Hold  out.  Hold  out.  Hold  out. \n Go  on.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go.  Go.  Take \n your  time.  Take  your  time.  That  one \n isn't  it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go,  go,  go.  You, \n Daniel,  go  on  that,  you  humble  bean. \n Black  magic  always  works.  That's  what \n I'm  talking  about  right  now.  I've  just \n realized  this  is  a  building.  I'm \n cheating  off  the  bat.  Oh  well,  I'll  use \n it  as  a  vantage  point.  But  this  is \n definitely  cheating.  I'll  give  Josh  a \n ring  at  the  top  and  see. \n But  I  guess  when  I'm  on  the  roof,  I'm \n technically  outside.  I  don't  think  he \n would  be  near  the  river.  Should  we \n Should  we  walk  in  land?  Okay,  group \n leader,  lead  us.  No,  not  group  leader. \n Okay,  fine.  Group  leader.  Everybody \n follow  me. \n Game  three.  As  you  know,  it's  11:00  a.m. \n So  technically,  it's  after  8. \n I  need  one  person  from  each  team  to  come \n outside  to  take  part  in  the  challenge. \n You're  going  to  place  your  after  eight \n on  your  forehead.  Go.  Not  yet.  It  is \n your  job  to  get  in  your  mouth,  but  you \n cannot  use  your  hands  first.  Do  it.  Get \n to  go.  Three,  two,  one,  go.  Danny,  jump, \n Simon's  done  it.  Simon's  good.  Done. \n Let's  go. \n So,  what  can  we  just  go?  Yeah.  All \n right.  L.  Bye,  Toby.  We're  going to \n lose,  man.  Oh,  we're  here.  We've  done \n it.  We've  done  it.  We've  done  it.  We've \n done  it. \n Okay.  I'm  going to  have  to  order  some \n water  to  my  hiding  spot  in  a  second.  I'm \n thinking  St.  Paul's  is  a  good  is  a  cool \n place  to  hide  around  there.  I'm  also \n thinking  like  you  see  down  there  or \n where  the  boat's  going  past.  There  must \n be  some  trees  in  there  I  can  hide  in. \n Right.  Left  or  right?  Wait,  wait,  wait. \n I'm  waiting.  I  see  a  light  bulb.  You  see \n the  light  bulb?  You  see  the  light  bulb? \n Got  him.  But  oh  my  god,  why  are  we \n running,  y'all?  I  lost  a  scent.  Oh  man. \n Oh  no.  All right.  Where  would  Harold  go? \n I  kind  of  wanted  to  play  more  games. \n I'll  be  honest.  I  actually  in  there.  I \n was going  to  say  I'm  a  little  bit  upset \n I  won  that.  Yeah.  I'm  sorry.  You  You \n [ __ ]  sweat.  Game  four  is  bottle  flip \n elimination.  Jeremy,  I  need  one  person \n from  each  team  against  Jeremy  in  this \n room.  Very  simple  rules.  Uh  you  all  do  a \n bottle  flip  and  whoever  lands  it  goes  to \n the  next  round.  Okay.  If  no  one  lands \n it,  we  go  back  again.  Okay. \n Miss  extension. \n [Music] \n Lands  it.  One  person's  landed  so  fast. \n So  if  neither  of  you  two  land,  Ethan \n secured  it.  Done. \n Go  Italian.  That  was  weak. \n Oh,  okay.  You  are  out. \n You're  out.  Well  done,  boys. \n There's  a  disadvantage  of  going  first. \n Uh,  Ethan,  go. \n Wait,  wait,  wait.  Stay  there.  Stay \n there. \n You're  out.  He  turns  off.  He  turns  off. \n Oh,  show.  One  v  one. \n Oh,  no  look.  No  look.  Why  did  you  do \n that?  To  win  it.  To  win  the  whole  win. \n Could  be  it. \n Let's  go. \n Let's  go.  We  can  go.  Let's  go. \n Okay.  Time  to  head  back  down  and \n actually  find  my  spot  cuz  this  is  I \n don't  think  this  I  don't  think  this  can \n run  unfortunately.  All  right.  I  actually \n need  to  properly  dial  in  now  because \n people  are  going  to  have  been  released \n and  looking  for  me  actively.  So,  I  need \n to  be  sneaky.  Wait,  how  do  we  get  down? \n I  just  saw  a  man  in  a  blue  jumper \n jogging.  We  go  down  there  if  you  want  to \n go  down. \n You've  got  a  good  knowledge  of  Harry's \n mind.  Yeah,  I  think  he  might  be  hiding \n in  plain.  Is  he  in  the  car?  He's  either \n in  St.  Paul's  or  he's  here.  I  think  he \n turned  right.  You  can  sense  it.  It's \n like  I  can  sense  it.  I  can  sniff  him \n out.  Let's  do  that.  Yeah.  You  haven't \n seen  someone  in  a  blue  hoodie  today, \n have  you?  Okay,  don't  worry.  So,  it's \n worth  a  nice  worth.  We're  We're  hunting \n someone.  This  is  so  hard.  This  thing  is \n so  big.  What  do  you  want  to  do  now?  Do \n you  want  to  go  barbec?  Yeah.  You  reckon \n he's  there?  He  knows  it  quite  well, \n doesn't  he?  Like  on  the  map,  are  we \n right  in  the  middle  of  the  city  of \n London?  We're  technically  not  even  in \n City  of  London  right  now.  We're  Oh,  so \n we  need  to  actually  head  that  way.  Okay. \n Should  we  do  should  we  look  at  the  the \n riverside  first?  Yeah,  let's  go  to  the \n river.  The  likelihood  of  us  finding  him \n is  so  unlikely,  right?  So  small.  So \n small.  Okay.  Right.  We're  out.  This  is \n crunch  time.  I  think  people  have  have \n been  released.  I'm  assuming  it's  been \n about  30  minutes.  So,  I  need  to  find  my \n spot  carefully.  The  thing  is,  my  heart's \n going  now.  If  I  see  a  blue  jumper,  I'm \n going  to  I'm  going  to  [ __ ]  myself.  I \n I've  just  got  to  stick  to  these  like \n back  paths.  No  main  roads.  Keep  a  low \n head.  And  then  if  I  spot  anything  blue, \n just  le  it  cuz  I  don't  want  I  don't  want \n anyone  winning  this  money.  I'm  actually \n fighting  for  Cburn's  money  here.  Got  to \n hope  the  other  guys  find  me.  Game  five. \n Guess  the  number  inside  his  envelope. \n I've  written  the  number.  The  closest  one \n gets  to  go  next.  Right.  TV  reveal.  Oh, \n 98.  Simon  Char  match  score.  It  was  99 \n penalties. \n Oh  yeah.  Can  I  change  it?  99.  All right. \n Vickar  75.  75.  71.  71.  We've  gone  36. \n And  that  leaves  you  with  number  one. \n Okay.  There's  a  very  very  clear  winner \n here.  Keep  laughing  at  them. \n We  go.  Thank  you,  sir.  Off  you  go.  There \n is  a  like  a  beach.  Hey,  a  duck.  I  don't \n know  if  that's  in.  Should  we  go  down  and \n have  a  look  at  the  beach?  Oh,  there's \n Donnie  having  a  piss  over  there.  What? \n Hey, \n boy.  Put  your  knob  away. \n A  blue  van.  I'm  telling  you,  all  the \n signs  are  pointing  to  finding  him.  Are \n they?  We're  seeing  a  lot  of  blue.  And \n we're  off,  Jim.  We're  off.  The  boys  are \n gone.  Why  is  he  making  us  go  on  line \n bites?  I'm  going  to  go  try  Parliament. \n And  then  we're  going  to  go  and  try  the \n palace.  Game  six.  Spin  the  bottle. \n A  little  kissy  kissy  at  the  end.  All \n right.  One  spin.  Whoever  it  lands  on \n gets  to  go  next.  Let's  go.  I'll  see  you \n guys  in  a  bit.  Let's  go.  Oh  my  god.  I \n just  calculated.  Let's  go.  We  done  it. \n We  done  it.  We  done  it.  We  done  it. \n Big  Stockhold  moment.  See  you  nerds.  See \n you  nerds.  See  you  nerds.  Even  like  a \n bush  like  that  isn't  bad.  But  no,  it's \n so  obvious  that  you'd  see  a  blue  jumper \n in  there.  So  obviously  this  front  path \n is  just  so  bait  though.  People  are \n obviously  going  to  walk  along  here.  What \n a  beautiful  day.  This  is  where  I've  got \n to  be  careful.  This  is  so  exposed. \n Either  he's  gone  somewhere  like  nice \n like  down  the  river  or  he's  gone  into \n like  shortoritch  east  London  side.  He \n knows  that  area  well.  It's  just  on  the \n edge  like  that  side  of  city  of  London. \n Toby,  I'm  going  to  be  honest.  Put  in  all \n my  effort  already.  Must  be  a  leisurely \n stroll,  you  know.  Just  getting  steps  in \n today,  honestly.  Is  there  a  spot  that \n Harry  would  go?  Let's  get  in  our  mind. \n Let's  get  in  get  in  the  Harry  mind.  In \n the  mind  of  Harry.  These  trees.  That's \n what  I'm  after.  I  think  people  know  me \n and  they  know  I'm  a  sucker  for  a  river \n view.  So,  they  might  think  I'm  here. \n Test  the  viability  of  these  trees.  Oh, \n this  is  just  too  This  is  too  exposed, \n isn't  it?  This  is  way  too  exposed.  These \n bushes  up  here,  I  can  get  behind  that, \n you  know.  But  is  this  how  What  is  this? \n The  Richard  Desmond.  It  looks  kind  of \n empty.  They  going  to  tell  me  off  for \n hiding  in  a  bush.  I  don't  know.  Oh  my \n god.  It's  got  This  is  it,  right?  If  I \n can  get  in  this  bush.  I'm  Harry.  Where \n would  I  hide?  I  would  hide  in  something. \n Oh,  there's  lots  of  bins  around  the \n center.  Let's  find  a  bin.  Do  you  reckon \n he's  hiding  in  a  bin?  That  is  a  Harry \n run  if  I've  ever  seen  one.  That's  a \n great  Harry  run. \n [Laughter] \n I  know  where  he  is.  Where?  Go  up  here. \n Take  the  second  right.  Mhm.  Turn  left. \n Mhm.  He's  He's  there  in  that  vicinity. \n Yeah.  Okay.  Trust  me,  mate.  If  I  sit  in \n there,  they  ain't  finding  me.  They  ain't \n finding  me.  There's  no  way.  Go  in  the \n bush.  Go  in  the \n bush.  Tell  me  there's  nothing  like \n sketchy  in  here,  mate.  That's  my  spot.  I \n found  it.  Jack,  it's  been  good  knowing \n you.  I'll  see  you.  I'll  see  you  on  the \n other  side,  my  friend.  Oh,  no. \n Ah,  just  a  sleeping  bag.  There's  not \n someone  in  that.  That's  fine.  Oh,  it  is \n [ __ ]  Oh,  it's  not  nice  in  here.  But \n that's  the  that's  the  the  way  of  the \n game.  Got  to  go  where  you  don't  want  to \n go.  Does  this  count  as  the  second \n right?  Second  right  to  the  left.  Right. \n This  is  the  left,  Simon.  No,  I  know,  but \n I'm  just  checking.  You  know, \n you  hiding  in  the  bush  somewhere.  Just \n check  up  here. \n There's  no \n way.  Going  to  have  a  quick  quick  dabble \n in  this  area. \n Simon.  Simon.  How  the  [ __ ]  have  they \n found  me?  Oh  my  [ __ ]  How  the  [ __ ]  have \n they  found  me  already?  How  the  [ __ ]  have \n you  found  me  already?  No, \n mate.  I  got  in  here  30  seconds  ago.  Oh, \n I  got  in  here  30  seconds  ago.  You \n bastards.  I  channeled  by  Harry.  No,  you \n don't  understand.  I've  been  up  I've  been \n up  monument  the  whole  time.  I've  just \n You  found  me  straight  away.  He  said  I \n know  where  Harry  is.  We're  going  to  go \n up  there.  Take  a  second  right,  first \n left,  and  he's  in  that  vicinity.  And  I \n followed  the  exact  instructions.  No, \n your  ankles  are  exposed,  bro.  You  got  to \n hide  them.  [ __ ]  They'll  never  find  us \n here.  You  don't  think  you  found  me \n straight  away?  Yeah,  but  I  channeled \n Harry. \n Game  seven,  higher  or  lower  elimination. \n Oh  my  god.  Who  wants  to  go  first?  Jamie. \n Yep.  Simple  game.  I'll  put  a  card  down. \n You  say  higher  or  lower.  If  you  get  it \n wrong,  you're  out.  Cool.  Simple.  Yeah. \n Get  it  right.  What?  Queen.  Lower. \n Three.  So  then  higher.  Oh  god.  I'm  going \n six  in  it.  Eight.  Eight.  Oh  bloody \n lower. \n Jack,  two  from  Jack. \n Lower.  Yeah,  he  didn't.  Six.  Yes. \n Are  you  sure?  Higher.  Higher.  Higher. \n Yes. \n Get  out  of  here,  man.  Yes.  Gosh  dang  it. \n You  were  saying  no  as  well.  Gosh  dang \n it.  This  is  a  good  spot,  though. \n Well,  evidently.  Evidently  not. \n Evidently  not.  But  I  found  within \n literally  I  swear  30  seconds  I  was  in \n here  for.  Yeah,  but  we  are  alive.  Hide \n and  seekers.  You  actually  just  don't \n understand.  That  was  one  of  the  coldest \n moments.  It  was  actually  like  the \n coldest.  Hello.  I  see  you  getting  in  the \n car.  We're  driving.  Do  you  want  to  lift? \n So  where?  Uh,  we're  going  to  Rivertemp. \n Uh,  the  Rivertemp  is  there.  See  you \n later.  He's  an  island  boy.  I  would  like \n to  propose  that  we  take  a  pit  stop  to \n the  riverfront.  We  might  catch  a  whiff \n of  him  with  the  Yeah.  Catch  a  little \n smell.  The  temp's  breeze.  The  final \n game.  Soggy  biscuit.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  Go. \n It's  my  first  shoot  when  we  do  soggy \n biscuit.  Oh,  I'm  hungry  as  well.  It  is \n rock,  paper,  scissors.  Obviously, \n winning  team  gets  to  go  and  losing  team, \n you'll  be  here  with  me  for  a  little  bit \n longer.  One,  two,  three.  Shoot.  Yes.  One \n new  AB.  Come  on,  Arthur.  Is  that  a  free? \n Oh,  no. \n Come  on.  Okay,  you  got  this.  AB.  Come \n on,  Arthur. \n No,  no,  no,  no,  mate.  I'm  just  going  to \n kill  me  here.  Just  I'll  lie  here.  And \n we're  stuck  with  him  as  well  for  [ __ ] \n sake.  You  on  your  own  if  you  want.  No, \n no,  I'm  joking.  I'm  joking.  Can  we  go \n inside?  It's  okay.  You  guys  are  here. \n It's  so  cold  out  here.  I  didn't  say \n that.  I  didn't  say  that.  You  too.  You're \n part  of your  team.  Hurry  up,  James.  I'm \n here.  Anytime  soon.  It's  a  red.  Why  am  I \n paired  with  the  most  dangerous \n northerner?  Yes,  we're  on  a  bike.  They \n don't  apply  to  us.  Yes,  they  do.  No, \n they  don't.  Because  there's  a  big  red \n bike.  Oh,  you've  got  squeeze.  No  room. \n You've  got  no  room.  Look  at  the  parking \n deckers.  Oh,  I  think  they're  moving.  Oh, \n hell  yeah.  He  put  it  in  easy  mode.  He \n made  it  easy.  He  made  it  easy.  Easy \n mode.  Seat  belt.  Hey,  seat  belt.  Buckle \n up,  man.  Where's  the  unpredictable \n route?  I  think  this  seems  like  a  route \n that  no  one  would  go.  So,  we're  looking \n for  loads  of  blue  boys.  This  is  freaking \n exciting.  Why  haven't  you  got  your \n glasses  on?  Cuz  I  look  better  without  my \n glasses  on,  Will.  It's  not  about  looking \n stylish.  We've  got  to  see  him.  You're \n going  to  have  to  have  eyes  like  a  hawk. \n This  is  great  experience,  man.  What \n would  he  do?  Think.  Do  you  know  where  I \n think  he  would  hide?  At  a  train  station. \n That's  his  worst  [ __ ]  nightmare.  Is \n it?  Think  about  that.  In  a  train \n station.  He's  going  to  hide  where  no  one \n no  people  are.  Where  you  going  to  go? \n We're  thinking  Harry  is  going  to  want  to \n enjoy  his  time  waiting.  So  I  was \n thinking  surely  he's  going  to  be  want  to \n be  the  by  the  wateride  in  the  sun \n chilling  by  the  river.  It's  not  really \n hot.  Like  it's  all  very  open.  You  should \n have  stayed  up  monument.  No  one  would \n have  found  you  there.  You  reckon? \n I'll  be  I'll  be  honest  with  you.  Tourist \n started  coming  up  and  I  got  scared.  Had \n the  whole  thing  to  myself.  This  this \n position  we've  got  going  on  right  now.  I \n think  this  is  good.  I'm  not  comfy  right \n now. \n It's  not  about  being  cop.  There's  20 \n grand  on  the  line  here,  fell.  But  like \n what  if  like  you're  sat  there  and  I'm \n sat  in  this  bush  and  they  see  you  two. \n Yeah.  If  they  see  us  hiding,  then  they \n know  we're  hiding  with  you.  Cuz  you  have \n to  just  start  buming  or  something.  Just \n say,  \"Oh  yeah,  we're  having  a  quick  in \n the  bush.\"  Like  come  up  with  some  excuse \n or  something.  If  you  if  you  dive  into \n that  sleeping  bag,  Yeah.  I'll  bum  Toby. \n Okay, \n cool.  Where's  my  say  in  this?  It's  a \n foolproof  plan,  mate.  We  can't  we  can't \n backtrack  now.  Okay,  you  can  bum  me. \n Fears.  Little  do  the  boys  know,  I'm  now \n sending  out  seven  Harry  decoys  into  the \n playing  area  to  try  and  throw  the \n YouTuber  teams \n off.  The  world's  greatest  blue  hoodie  is \n finally  back  in  stock.  Judging  by  this \n video,  we  may  have  accidentally  started \n a  cult.  Uh  so  if  you  don't  want  to  be \n left  out,  grab  it  now  on  sideclo.com  or \n on  the  sideclo  app. \n Nice.  This  is  such  a  ridiculous \n challenge,  man.  I  feel  stupid  just  doing \n this.  We  need  to  think  neurode \n divergently.  Why  have  you  asked  me  about \n that?

Lunch.  Shrink \n the  [ __ ]  circle.  Zurka.  Circle. \n Shrink  inbound.  And  a  clue  coming  for \n us. \n Yes.  I  mean,  do  you  feel  brave  enough  to \n have  uh  have  a  look  in  or  will  it  tempt \n you?  I'll  I'll  quickly  have  a  look.  No, \n I  think  we  I  I'll  have  a  You  go  in. \n Yeah.  I'll  look  around.  Don't  Don't \n move.  Why  not?  Fire,  mate.  You  haven't \n possibly  seen  anyone  in  a  jumper  like \n this  today,  have  you?  Blue  hoodie.  No. \n Thank  you.  No  worries.  You  on?  Trust  me. \n I  got  brave.  I  can  just  100%.  You're  on. \n Yeah.  100  million%.  Okay.  You  kind  of \n need  to  be  my  navigation  as  well,  bro.  I \n don't  know  where  we're  going.  I'm  going \n left.  Oh,  left.  Yeah.  Go  on.  You  right, \n bro.  Don't  worry  about  me.  Go.  I'm \n feeling  confident.  Yeah,  but  the  Phoenix \n thing.  What  is  the  Phoenix  thing  all \n about?  Ignore  it.  What  do  you  mean \n ignore  it,  bro?  Danny  and  J.  That's  not \n fair.  Well,  who's  that?  That's  mental. \n Where  the  heck  is  this?  Who's  up  there? \n Zan.  Is  that  R  for  TV?  Where?  Oh  [ __ ] \n Oh,  the  boys  are  here.  You  know,  you \n know,  with  that  clue  thing,  we  ain't \n finding  him  for  a  while.  Wait,  why?  We \n got  a,  you  know,  very  explicit  clue.  And \n we  just  found  You  got  a  clue?  Huh?  I \n didn't  get  a  clue.  If  it's  that \n impossible,  share,  share  it  with  the \n boys.  Yeah.  Tell  them.  We  already  know \n one  team.  Yeah.  Yeah,  look,  we  are  all \n just  brothers  and  sisters.  Circle \n shrunk. \n Where's  it  now?  You're  lying,  mate.  Are \n you  lying?  It's  shrunk.  Why  would  I  lie \n about  that?  And  of  course,  once  again, \n like  any  battle  royale  type  game,  as  the \n map  is  so  large,  the  zone  will  begin  to \n start  shrinking  as  time  progresses  to \n make  the  game  easier  and  easier.  So, \n this  is  our  first  shrinkage  of  the \n circle.  Well,  that's  barely  shrunk,  has \n it?  I  know,  but  at least  Barbin's  not  in \n cuz  Barb's  a  hell.  Maybe  somewhere  near \n Black  Fryers.  I  don't  know.  Barbin's  out \n of  it,  bro.  Oh  my  god. \n Do  we  go  to  the  river?  What  do  we  do?  We \n could  hit  the  black  black  vi.  No.  Go  on. \n How  much?  How  do  you  say  that?  Black \n Fars. \n No.  No.  Try  again.  Black  Ferraris. \n So,  the  circle's  just  shrunk  and  the \n barb's  not  in  it.  And  the  barbins  where \n we're  at,  but  it's  just  next  to  where  it \n is.  So,  back  in  the  car.  I  don't  like \n that  Arthur  said  they've  done  the  river, \n but  no.  Oh,  someone. \n What?  I  just  saw  someone.  I  don't  know \n why  we're  running.  Were  they  by \n themselves? \n Oh  no.  Someone  [ __ ]  Look,  it's  blue \n fleece.  Rats.  How's  it  taking  him  this \n long  to  have  the  emoji?  Cuz  he  didn't \n expect  anyone  to  pick  emoji.  That's  why. \n Emoji  ble.  Yeah.  Oh,  we  can  shrink  the \n circle.  We  can  give  you  the  directions \n or  send  you  an  emoji.  He  just  chose \n emoji.  Okay,  I  really  had  to  pee,  but \n that's  done.  We'll  go  back.  Do  you  think \n that  anyone's  going to  be  there?  No, \n they  all  stink.  I  think  Arthur  is  the \n best  bet  because  I  think  he  was  actually \n quite  suspicious.  He  was  someone  said \n Phoenix.  So,  I've  asked  about  the \n Phoenix  and  they  said  if  if  you're  out \n if  this  is  a  place  that's  outside,  the \n Phoenix  on  top  of  St.  Paul's  Cathedral \n was  definitely  prominent  feature.  So,  I \n don't  know.  St.  Paul's  Cathedral.  St. \n Paul.  Yeah.  I  mean,  you're  going  to  have \n to  direct  me,  boss.  Chill  chill  chill. \n I'll  call  you.  Okay.  Oh  no.  Wait.  Wait. \n Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Dropping  in  three, \n two,  you  can.  I'm  ready.  I'm  ready  at \n all  times.  Always  ready.  We're  going. \n Always  ready.  We're  going.  I  can  even \n pull  and  go  faster  than  you.  Go  on  then. \n You've  got  balls.  Go  then.  Right.  I'm \n I'm  cutting  traffic.  I'm  cutting \n traffic.  Go,  go,  go,  go,  go.  Don't  worry \n about  me  ever.  I'm I'm  Wait.  Are  we \n going  right  here?  No.  Straight. \n Straight.  Straight.  Straight.  Straight. \n Straight.  Straight.  That's  it.  There. \n Yeah.

Yeah. \n The  emojis  we've  got  are  bank,  receipt, \n coffee,  fire,  and  fishing.  Oh,  we're \n next  to  a  fishing  store.  No,  we're  not. \n Go  outdoors.  It's  by  St.  Paul's.  Oh  my \n god.  There's  got  to  be  a  coffee  shop \n next  door.  It's  near  St  Paul's  as  well. \n Oh,  let's  go.  Okay.  I  don't  see  a  blue \n hoodie,  so  we're  all  good.  Sorry.

How  many  of  them  have  figured  out \n that  we  found  them?  None.  I  don't  think \n cuz  it's  not.  We  could  be  trolling  like \n Theo  said.  I  know  where  he  is.

We're  having  a \n coffee  break.  He's  just  running  after \n him.  Why  do  you  look  so  beused?  Why?  We \n want  to  know  why  you're  here.  Uh  why  are \n you  here?  Have  you  got  any  clues?  Yes. \n Same.  Do  you  want  to  swap?  Yes.  Okay. \n We've  got  an  emoji  clue.  We  have  a \n couple.  We've  got  emoji  and  a  riddle.  We \n got  Great  Fire  London.  So  we  we  made \n Great  Fire  London.  Well,  that's  that's \n here.  Yeah,  that's  why  we're  here.  Okay. \n Um  but  it's  just  closed  for  now.  It's \n closed  for  now,  but  he  might  still  be  up \n there.  Yeah,  he's  got  I  think  he's  gone. \n I'm  convinced  that  AI  has  done  it  for \n him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or  it  says  copium.  No, \n cuz  he's  he  always  says  you  can  climb \n monument \n and  word.  You  think  he's  up  monument?  I \n think  he's  up  monument.  Oh  my  word. \n Yeah.  And  he's  on  pudding.  Yeah.  Oh  wow. \n Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He  always  goes  on \n about  it.  Right  now  we  need  to  ask \n people  if  they've  seen  Harry  wrote  a \n shore.  I've  lost  my  [ __ ]  teammate. \n Let's  go.  You  think  he's  up  there?  I  do \n think  he's  up  there.  You  like  We  can't \n go  there  until  2:00,  so  we  might  as  well \n have  a  look  around.  Let's  go  pub. \n That'll  solve  all  our  problems.  We'll  go \n pub  near  the  hotel.  Yeah.  Come  up  with  a \n plan.  Get  a  little  bit  wonky.  Yeah.  Oh, \n this  is  us.  Man  on.  Man  on.  Right.  We're \n getting  in  an  Uber  to  the  other  side  of \n the  map.  We've  up  the  budget. \n Let's  go.  Let  you  go. \n Please  leave.  There's  someone  there. \n It's  It's  going  to  make  people  not  look \n here  cuz  they're  going  to  look  at \n something. \n Yeah.  Who's  that?  Oh  my  god.  I  think  the \n These  are  decoys.  These  are  100%  decoys. \n Oh,  it's  a  decoy.  You  decoy. \n O.  No,  they're  actually  are  fully \n decoys.  Why  is  there  decoy  people?  That \n is  not  fair.  Get  a  life,  mate.  Do  you \n know what  I  mean?  Do  you  think  they're \n tricking  us?  I  can't  believe  there's \n actually  people  that  Yeah,  I  thought \n they  were  joking.  Yeah,  like  that's \n mental. \n How  long  is  your  [ __ ] \n lunch?  This  one \n [Music] \n sandwich.  This  is  so  bad. \n Circle  shrinking.  Yeah,  we're  still  in \n it.  We're  still  in  it.  [ __ ]  He  can't  be \n down  there  because  the  tide's  in. \n Oh,  here  we  go.  Circle  shrinkage  too. \n That  doesn't  do  anything  for  us,  does \n it?  No.  I  think  it  might  be  quite  hot, \n you  know.  Where  is  that  Robert  Dyers? \n I'm  going  to  mark  it.  We  were  here  south \n of  that  is  like  close  to  us.  Let's  go \n down  here  until  we're  right  below  Robert \n Dyers  and  then  search  that  whole  area. \n If  they  find  us,  that  that  woman's  going \n to  then  find  out  we've  been  here  the \n whole  time. \n [ __ ] \n [Music] \n sake.  The  circle  has \n shrunk.  She  might  be  mad  at  us  though. \n No,  we  got  it  first.  Yeah,  we're  just \n hiding.  This  is  our  spot.  Yeah,  this  is \n our  picnic \n spot. \n Jesus.  Is  this  it?  Is  this  it?  I  think \n this  might  be  it.  Ethan,  they  look  like \n they're \n hiding.  Have  we  done  it?  Quick,  parkour \n with  me.  Have  we  done  it?  Parkour  with \n me. \n That's  close. \n What  is  going  on?  So,  he's  here.  Tell  me \n the  truth.  Did  you  send  me  a  clue?  Yeah, \n I  said  between  What  was  the  What  was \n your  clue? \n Yeah,  it  sounds  like  you.  So  Will  gave \n me  his  riddle.  They  told  me  some  balls \n and  I  got  emojis.  We  got  asked  it  to \n solve  the  emojis.  What's  the  fish \n though?  The  walrus,  the  pub.  Well,  he \n said  fish  market  nearby  river  temps.  I \n think  there's  a  fishing  place  further \n that  way.  But  everyone's  here.  He's  got \n to  be  on  the  river.  He  is  on  the  river. \n He's  going to  be  on  the  beach. \n It's  the  best  place  to  hide.  Do  you  not \n be  in  a  boat?  No.  Really?  Oh  my  god. \n Batch. \n Yeah.  Oh  my  god. \n Back.  Oh  my  god.  It's  some  pose.  It's \n some  pose.  There's  no  way.  Right. \n What? \n What?  Really?  Just  here?  Yeah. \n We  heard  Ethan  and  Vic  and  we  heard  Lock \n Randy.  Simon  and  Toby.  I  reckon  they \n found  him  in  our  ring.  He's  going  to  be \n along  here,  isn't  it?  We  was  here  so \n early.  Should  we  let  him  run?  Oh. \n No.  Why  are  we  running?  No.  Just  let  him \n go,  Ethan.  Man,  let  him  go.  Nope.  No, \n man.  Let  him  go.  Yeah,  Danny's  got  the \n right  idea.  Danny,  let  him  go,  Ethan. \n Let  him  go.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Why  is  this \n YouTuber  run  club?  Yeah,  it  might  as \n well.  Theo's  leading  a  run  club.  It's \n just  down  there.  All right,  Vic.  The \n tide's  in  now,  so  he  can't  be  in  that \n spot  that  we  thought.  I  think  we  keep \n going.  Yeah.  Yeah. \n I'm  going  to  park  it  up.  I'm  going  to \n park  it  up.  I'm  going  leave \n it.  Oh  my  god.  He's  literally  10  yard  10 \n y  over \n there.  Oh  my  god.  He  cycled  away.  He \n cycled  away. \n I  got  away.  You  just  got  my  own  blankets \n on  there. \n You  thought  this  was  a  bad  island  spot. \n Okay,  we  seem  to  take  a  photo  of  a  bus. \n Must  be  within  3  m  of  a  bus.  [ __ ] \n Driver,  you're  going  to  have  to  get \n techy.  Oh,  there's  a  buzz  up  ahead.  It's \n like,  can  I  just  jump  out  and  run  up  to \n that  bus?  Run,  run,  be  le  it.  First \n thing  to  take  a  photo  of  a  bus  must  be \n within  3  m  of  the  bus.  PK,  get  your  bus \n out.  Oh  my  god.  First  what? \n What  the  hell?  We  got  a  clue.  Yes.  It's \n first  team  to  take  a  boat  of  a  bus.  Must \n be  it.  Oh  my  god.  My  Send  it.  Send  on \n Wi-Fi.  Yes,  that's  it.  That's  surely  the \n clue.  Let's  go.  Oh,  they've  already  done \n it.  All right.  I'm  running  over  to  a  bus \n and  it's  driving  away.  Let's  quickly  get \n onto  this  bus.  Bless  him.  Here  it  is. \n He's  running  around  like  me.  3,  two, \n one.  I'm  within  3  meters.  Someone's  done \n it.  It's  PK.  PK.  PK.  Where  is  he  going? \n Honestly,  the  second  you  jumped  out,  he \n did  it.  So \n annoying.  Someone's  already  sent  a \n picture  of  the  button.  I'm  coming  back. \n That's  a  fish.  Yeah,  it's  a  seal.  How \n can  like  five,  six  people  with  Who's \n found  him?  Who  have  we  not  seen?  We \n haven't  seen  Weller  and  AB.  They're \n still  they're  doing  challenges.  So  they \n they're  still  trying  to  find  they're \n still  looking.  Toby  and  Simon  have  found \n him.  I  think  it's  good  that  we  got  away \n from  that  group  cuz  I  think  that  group \n is  the  blind  leading  the  blind.  I  don't \n I  don't  follow  them  blind,  bro.  I'm \n tired  of  this.  What  do  I  do?  Yeah,  he's \n not  going  to  be  like  directly  on  the \n river,  is  he?  He's  got  to  be  off  an \n offshoot.  Maybe  down  that  he  could  be \n anywhere,  right?  Oh,  this  is  so  Harry. \n Everyone  was  hanging  around  here.  He  has \n to  be  around  here.  Yeah.  Will  he  gave  me \n his  clue?  What's  the  clue?  Uh  something \n like  something  something  like  Jamie  I'm \n shaped  like  will  square  where  the \n interest  rates  are  high  and  the  phoenix \n meets  the  sky  or  some  [ __ ]  So  Phoenix \n financial  district  interest  rates  square \n square  any  square  that's  got  interest \n rates  high  2  hours  two  [ __ ] \n Is  there  a  printing  place  near  here? \n There  might  be.  I  think  there  might  be  a \n snappy  snaps.  If  I  print  off  a  picture \n of  Harry  and  put  it  on  my  face,  we  might \n be able  to  just  go  home. \n Or  like  a  3D. \n We  are  directly  south  of  the  thing  at \n the  moment.  So,  we  should  just  keep \n going.  Right.  Right.  Cuz  that's  more \n catching.  Yeah. \n I  hate  every  single  person  in  a  blue \n hoodie. \n Josh,  send  us  the  freaking  riddle. \n Calling. \n Hello,  Josh.  We're  losing  valuable  time. \n Can  we  get  the  riddle,  please?  Yeah, \n it's  in  down.  It's  in  down.  Relax.  Okay. \n Okay.  Thank  you.  That's  even  more \n infuriating.  I  hate  it  when  people  say \n that.  Oh,  so  cold.  I  need  a  wee.  I \n haven't  eaten  anything. \n Please  make  a  sign  if  you're  here, \n Harry.  Oh,  he's  just  not  though,  is  it? \n He's  not  here.  Just  causing  a  reason. \n Yep,  I  am.  Have  any  of  you  boys  seen \n Roers  Shaw?  No.  Are  you  joking  me? \n Oh,  you've  seen  him.  Have  you  seen \n Roshawore \n Harry  from  the  Have  you  seen  a  guy  in  a \n blue  hoodie  in  a \n No,  you've  let  me  down. \n Hello,  mate.  Why  are  you  pointing  the \n camera  over  there? \n I'm  getting  B-roll.  I'm  getting  B-roll. \n You  [ __ ]  Where  is  he?  He's  in  a  boat. \n He  says  getting  B-roll.  He's  pointing \n his  camera  roll  of  the  boat.  Getting  B- \n roll  of  the  city.  Show  me  how  far  that \n lens  goes.  Zoom  in. \n Is  there  someone  on  that  boat  in  a  blue \n jump?  Mate,  that  that  zoom  goes  miles \n all  all  the  way  at \n this  shard.  There's  something  going  on. \n There's  something  camera  over  there  as \n well.  Oh,  yeah.  There's  something  here, \n bro.  There's  something  here.  Get  me  off \n this  bike.  Where  is  he?  Up  there. \n Randy,  can  you  see  through \n there?  I'm  going  to  check  these  bushes \n over  here.  I  [ __ ]  sense  we're  close, \n man.  Unless  that  entire  group  has  now \n found  him.  We're  the  only  ones  that \n haven't. \n [Music] \n Just \n like  life  without  limits  center. \n [Music] \n That  literally  just  cycled  past. \n [Music] \n Who  was  that? \n I'm  [ __ ]  so  cold,  aren't  I?  No,  I'm \n so  cold.  I  know  I \n am.  They  are  both  the  other  side  of  the \n bushes  over  there.  But  this  woman  has \n been  sat  here  for  40  minutes. \n And  she's  she's  our  bodyguard. \n [Music] \n Hey.  I  don't  Yeah,  I  think  this  is \n inside  down  here. \n So  Oh, \n [ __ ]  I  need  to  ditch  this  bike.  Do  you \n want  to  try  and  work  this  out  with  me  or \n not?  Go  on.  Willie  gave  me  something \n about  Jamie.  Sounds  like  Jamie  or \n something  shaped  like  Willie  square \n where  the  interest  rates  are  high  and \n something  meets  the  sky.  And  Jack  was \n taking  a  photo  of  the  shot.  You  can't  go \n over  there  cuz  it's  all  across  the  map. \n Someone's  saying  these  decoys  are  evil \n as  well.  What  are  the  decoys?  I  don't \n know.  I  guess  maybe  the  cameraman  or \n maybe  they've  been  getting  clues  that \n aren't  real  or  something. \n Okay,  let's  move.  Let's  go  back.  Go \n back.  It's  back  on  the  B.  Oh  my  god. \n [Music] \n Right.  New  plan  is  the  tower  again  at \n monument  tower.  It  opens  in  9  minutes. \n So  unless  he  somehow  managed  to  be  on \n top  of  it  and  let  them  stay  in  it  whilst \n top,  I  don't  know.  It's  worth  checking. \n It's  worth  checking  for  sure.  All  right, \n you  lot.  We've  decided  to  get  noshed  off \n just  a  bit.  Can  you  see?  Can  you  see  it? \n Just  some  minor  foreplay.  Great  bit  of \n jokery.  No  one's  breaking  the  internet. \n I'll  pack  it  in.  We're  going  for  a \n drink.  Are  we  the  only  ones  who  haven't \n got  a  clip?  Yeah,  mate.  We  like  it  big \n time.  You  could  look  at  it  a  couple  of \n ways.  Like  sunny  day  out  in  London  with \n the  boys.  Little  pint,  you  know,  a \n little  bite,  little  motive.  It  is.  Or \n you  could  just  be  a  real  big  tryhard  and \n try  and  actually  win.  Like,  who  does \n that?  You  know what  I  mean?  Embarrassing \n really.  It's  a  YouTube  video.  Why  would \n you  try?  We're  here  for  a  laugh.  We've \n got  no  We  got  What  can  we  do?  We're  just \n in  London  walking  around  the  city  of \n London  looking  for  someone  that  we  have \n no  idea  where  he  is.  It's  not  possible \n to  find  him.  We've  got  the  riddle,  but \n it  means  nothing.  You  found  some  decoys. \n You've  talked  to  two  liars.  What  if \n they're  lying?  No,  they'd  be  with  him \n now  if  they  had  found  him.  They're \n idiots,  bro.  [ __ ]  damn.  You  silly \n boys.  Head  towards  your  four \n tires.  Black  friars.  There's  a  rhyme. \n There  is  my  is  what  I'm  thinking.  Or \n towards  our  bikes.  Our  bikes  are  there. \n Your  four  tires.  Black  friars.  Oh  my \n god.  What?  No.  Uh,  take  a  selfie  with \n the  ginger  person.  It's  him.  It's  you. \n Yes.  Go  on.  Go  on.  Go  on.  Go  on.  Go  on. \n Cameraman  doesn't  count.  The  first  time \n someone  actually  wants  to  meet  a  ginger \n person  and  then  to  be  seen.  No,  I'm \n joking. \n Go  on.  Go  on.  Go  on.  Quickly.  Wait.  Can \n I  take  a  Can  I  take  a  picture  with  you \n real  quick?  Just  real  quick. \n Nice  to  meet  you.  Oh,  wait.  Wait.  You \n might  have  have  it.  You  might  have  it. \n Jason  winner.  Yes.  Hey,  we  won  the \n challenge.  Nice. \n Oh,  Jason's  won  it  already.  [ __ ]  Four \n tires.  This  is  bugging  me.  Extra  circle \n shrink  direction  to  head  in.  Um,  circle \n shrink.  You know,  circle  shrink,  I \n guess.  Yeah. \n [Music] \n She's  gone.  She's  gone.  Imagine \n terrifying  if  she  did  see  us.  She  just \n sees  three  men  in  the  bush  behind  her. \n It  would  have  been  so  funny  though.  By \n the  way,  the  zero  survival  instinct,  she \n dies  in  any  horror  movie.  Oh,  she  just \n too  special  to  go.  Yeah,  but  who's  going \n to  think  there's  three  Donnies  in  the \n bush?  The  bushes  were  rustling  the  whole \n time.  She  didn't  even  look  behind.  Made \n that  noise  while  she  was \n We've  been  hiding  with  Harry  2  and \n literally  since  the  very  start.  Mate, \n this  is  maybe  the  sunniest  day  in  London \n we've  had  in  in  weeks  and  [ __ ]  sat  in \n a  bush. \n That's  just  a  bold  deco.  I  just  face  on \n smiling.  You  know  you  aren't  Harry.  You \n know  who  you  are.  I  saw  your  face. \n You're  a  liar.  You're  a  liar. \n Shade.  Have  some  shade  pallet.  Boo. \n Yeah,  you're  right.  They're  trying  to \n leave  us  away.  They're  trying  to  get  us \n away  from  him.  They're  trying  to  get  us \n away.  No.  No.  No.  He's  already  up  there. \n He's  already  up.  They  know  it  opens  at \n two.  Yeah.  What's  the  Is  this  the \n phoenix  in  the  sky? \n Maybe.  [ __ ]  Should  we  go?  There's \n Harry.  Why  is  Randy  shouting  Harry?  Oh \n yes.  Oh  yes. \n Okay,  just  for  real.  That's  not  Harry, \n is  it?  Is  that \n Harry?  Have  they  got  [ __ ]  decoys? \n That  decoy  is  not  cool.  That  got  me \n hookline  and  sinker.  Is  that  him?  I \n think  it  was  a  decoy.  All  right,  this  is \n a  sort  of  mockup.  And  PK,  you're  going \n to  have  to  blur  that  number.  Uh,  what  do \n you  think,  Joe?  That's  my \n number.  You  got  to  blur  that  [ __ ]  out. \n What  the  [ __ ]  Have  you  seen  this,  man? \n Oh,  sure. \n Yeah.  Please,  can  I  picture  you? \n You  don't  want  to  have  that.  You  don't \n have  that  show.  Let's  get  your  number  on \n it.  Why  you  walking  away  from  the \n camera,  guys?  We  found  him.  We  were  so \n close  to  him.  Why  was  Jack  and  Charlie \n there?  Let's  go  back  there.  In  Sure. \n Let's  go  back  there.  There's  a  depot \n right  here.  Let's  go  back  to  the  place \n that  we've  that  we've  searched  high  and \n low  while  everyone  else  is  walking  the \n streets  of  London.  All right.  New  circle \n drop. \n Yes,  where  we  are \n still.  The  circle  shrunk \n again.  Oh,  boys,  please.  This  might \n sound  weird.  Is  anyone  up  there  in  a \n blue  jumper? \n Yeah,  I  Let  me  just  double  check.  Double \n check,  Will.  We'll  let  you  double  check, \n Will.  Come  on.  Piggy.  Piggy.  Piggy. \n Piggy.  Harold.  Louis,  my  back  is  I've \n been  here  for  3  hours.  Bum  is  finished. \n Back  is  finished.  Everything  finished. \n Bits.  Yeah.  For  a  monument  there. \n I  want  someone  to  find  us  so  that  that \n we  can  then  do  the  next  step  of  the \n mission,  which  is  like  an  excursion,  but \n we  just  No  one's  found  us.  Stuck  in  the \n bush.  The  bush  boys.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, \n hopefully  getting  food  delivery  soon. \n That's  what  I'm  hoping.  I  want  cushions. \n Drums. \n No,  don't  give  up.  Don't  give  up. \n Don't  give  up.  We're  so  cooked.  Don't \n give  up.  Why?  Don't  give  up.  Give  me  one \n good  reason.  No,  we're  close,  man.  We're \n close.  We're  not.  We're  close.  We're  not \n up  there.  Up  up up up up  this  bit  near \n the  start.  He's  He's  here,  right?  We  are \n really  struggling.  God  damn  it.  We're \n now  worrying  whether  we  should  have \n stuck  around  St.  Paul's  Cathedral  Bank \n cuz  a  lot  of  people  were  there  and  now \n they're  goodness  knows  where.  Oh  god,  it \n would  be  such  a  stinker  for  last  out.  Oh \n yes,  the  end.  The  end  is  inside.  Come \n on,  Harold.  Here  he  is.  It's  already  the \n end  of  the  video.  The  winner's \n POV.  Here  comes \n Harold.  Harry.  Harry,  where  are  you? \n Harry,  he's  not  here. \n Okay,  mission  failed.  All right.  Uh, \n complete  lack  of  success.  Uh,  he  is  not \n here.  Um,  and  I  also  can't  see  him  from \n afar.  Well,  we'll  send  Will  up.  We'll \n send  Will  up.  Then  Jay's  away  for  Will. \n Walk  all  the  way  down  the  stairs  again. \n There's  Randolph.  What?  He  was  heading \n in  the  right  direction  and  now  he's  he's \n just  having  a  sit  down.  Who's  given \n Randolph  that  massive  [ __ ]  camera?  I \n don't  get  why  we  saw  the  cameraman  that \n was  attached  to  Harry.  I  don't  care  if \n that's  like  cheating.  We  found  that's  a \n clue  and  we've  left  the  area  and  we  told \n Batch  and  Theo  that  and  they  got  excited \n and  went  there  and  now \n Lux  for  some  reason  has  gone  up  there. \n Oh,  for  [ __ ]  sake.  Really?  He's  not. \n Mate,  how  many  stairs?  Oh  my  god.  Will  I \n have  to  come  up  anyway,  mate?  Yeah, \n that's  fair  enough.  Cuz  I've  done  it \n now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah,  I  wish  you  all \n the  best.  Thank  you,  bro. \n It's  not  there.  Were  you  the  only  one \n that  came  up  here?  Yeah.  Well,  that  was \n [ __ ]  dreadful.  K  has  no  chin.  I  agree \n with  everything  Will  just  said. \n Wow.  Oh,  my  legs  are  [ __ ]  jelly.  I \n can  see  quite  a  lot  from  up  here.  That's \n a  positive.  Ethan,  I  don't  believe  in \n him  anymore.  Yeah,  I  do.  I  don't  believe \n in  Harry.  No,  he  exists.  He  exists  and \n he's  near  here.  No,  he's  by  St.  Paul's. \n I  tell  you  what,  he's  down  by  the  river, \n man.  He's  not.  He  is.  How  many  times \n have  we  walked  up  and  down  that  river? \n Ethan, \n you  just  stuff  in  your  face.  Yeah.  Fish \n and  chips.  We're  [ __ ]  dying  in  this \n bush  for  3  hours.  I'm  dying  in  this \n bush.  Where's  Where's  the  afters?  Did \n you  not  give  them  a  clue? \n Yeah,  we  told  them  about  um  that  they \n bumped  into  two  liars  earlier  to  head \n back  to  like  their  line  bikes  but  in  a \n riddle  form,  but  they  haven't  started \n heading  towards  you  yet. \n Lux  and  Lux  and  Randy  came  so  close,  but \n they  just  they  they  was  there  around  you \n for  ages.  I  don't  know  why.  No,  Lux.  Lux \n literally  went  up  the  stairs  behind  us. \n It  was  that  we  had  we  had  that  woman \n being  our  security  guard  basically.  Like \n she  blocked  the  entrance  to  get  everyone \n away.  Oh  my  god.  Wait,  is  that  Harry? \n No,  this  could  be  a  decoy.  Oh  no,  Harry \n wouldn't  walk  away.  Yeah,  he  might.  Oh, \n if  that's  a  decoy,  I'll  be  fuming. \n Harry's  not  really  a  decoy.  He's  too \n tall.  Oh,  he's  slender.  He  has  to  be \n around  here.  Why  is  Charlie  here? \n Charlie's  following  Randy  Lux.  Charlie, \n that  is  not  B-roll.  We're  not  getting \n B-roll.  He's  here  somewhere.  Oh,  I'm \n just  Trust  me.  I  just  They  just  put  him \n in  a  random  spot.  It's  nice.  I  don't \n believe  you.  Not  for  a  second. \n [Music] \n Yeah,  of  course.  Have  you  seen  Have  you \n seen  Harry? \n You're  up  there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah,  cheers. \n I  think  they  may  just  be  talking  about \n the  blue  hoodies  rather  than  actually \n them.  I  can't  trust  anything \n anymore.  Where  did  Ethan  and  Vic  just \n go?  Oh.  Oh  my  god.  Wait,  mate.  He  could \n be  in  a  bush.  I  swear  that's  Ethan. \n [ __ ]  It's  [ __ ]  Ethan.  He  could  just \n be  in  a  crack  somewhere.  He  could  just \n be  here. \n [Music] \n You  ever  seen  a  guy  in  a  blue  jumper? \n That  isn't  us. \n There's  a  lot  of  blue.  He  can't  go  in \n buildings.  I  want  to.  Is  that  a  decoy \n there?  Yeah.  It's  a  decoy.  Yeah.  He's \n here  though,  bro.  He  is.  He's  here.  He's \n here  somewhere.  Have  you  seen  people \n disappearing  around  here?  No.  That's  the \n worst  thing  about  it.  He's  here,  bro. \n Why  he  Why  are  we  convinced  he's  here? \n He  is.  There's  decoys  everywhere.  All \n the  clues  said  he's  here.  We  need  to \n know  we're  around.  Every  clue  is  is  like \n here,  bro. \n Have  you  just  been  lighting  around  here \n the  whole  time?  No,  we  just  came  back \n here,  mate.  Billingsgate  old  Billings \n skate  market  is  here  as  well.  Yeah, \n that's  what  that's  exactly  that's  what  I \n was  saying.  Uh  this  I  Do  you  think  he's \n in  there?  Did  you  actually  search  in \n this?  We  went  through  this.  Remember,  we \n climbed.  We  park  all  over  that  wall.  But \n is  he  hiding  in  like  a  weird  cranny  in \n there?  Why  Why  is  Harry  Why  is  Harry \n sweating  this  so  much?  He's  in  I  think \n he's  in  this  bit,  bro.  He  has  to  be \n here.  Do  you  think  he's  in  the  bushes? \n But  it's  not  just  him.  We're  looking  for \n him  plus  other  people.  [ __ ]  hell, \n right?  Why  did  you  do  that?  I  told \n everyone  what  you  found  out  and  he \n sprinted  there  and  they  said  to  me, \"Why \n did  you  leave?  Why  did  you  not  convince \n looks  more?\"  Did  you  really  look?  Yeah. \n Yeah.  Did  I  really  look?  What  do  you \n think  I  did  now?  I  just  ski  right  off. \n Sure.  Let's  do  the  temp's  path  again  and \n then  take  a  left.  I  go  left.  Yeah.  Ah, \n hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  I  recognize \n you.  You  do  indeed.  I  do.  I  do  indeed. \n Go  go go  go go.  I've  had  a  beer,  so  this \n is  this  is  arguably  not  great,  but  oh \n well.  Right,  AB,  follow  me,  mate.  Two \n two  more  punches  when  I  start  to  get \n free.  Okay.  Right,  everybody.  Oh,  I  got \n something  in  my  eye  off  the  bat. \n Is  there  a  man  in  there?  No.  What  are \n you  doing?  I'm  being  deterred.  Yeah. \n Ethan,  can  you  send  me  the  emojis, \n please?  Yeah. \n Wow.  We  are  [ __ ]  We  are  all  [ __ ]  We \n are  all  [ __ ]  Should  we  all  just  go \n home,  bro?  Why  are  the  decoys  all \n loitering  around  here?  He's  here,  bro. \n He's  [ __ ]  here.  I  believe  the  decoys \n are  following  us.  They're  not  an \n indication  of  where  he  is.  No,  but  they \n started  appearing  near  the  clues.  I  see \n him  to  get  a  selfie  on  a  bridge.  on  a \n bridge  for  [ __ ]  sake.  Well,  we  missed \n another  challenge.  No,  no,  it's  actually \n still  live.  What  is  it?  What  is  it?  A \n picture  of  a  bridge. \n [Music] \n Oh  my  god.  We  did  it.  We  did  it.  And \n Danny's  got  it.  Oh  [ __ ]  sake.  [ __ ] \n hell.  What  we  did?  There's  a  chance.  The \n riddle  is  let  me  cook.  Let  me  cook.  The \n riddle's  let  is  a  restaurant. \n Let  me  cook.  And  then  a  chef  emoji.  By \n the  way,  why  are  they?  They're  making  a \n mistake  hanging  out  with  the  sideman  cuz \n if  they  find  them  with  the \n [Music] \n [Music] \n side \n [ __ ]  [ __ ] \n be  fair,  right?  Actually,  we  want  to \n find  them  and  then  have  Ethan  find  them \n cuz  then  we  get  all  Yeah,  that's  a  good \n point.  This  is  nuts. \n We  are  still  just  in  the  catchment.  We \n could  probably  go  a  little  bit  further. \n Should  we  try  it?  Yeah.  Four  people \n outside  and  six.  Jesus  Christ.  Oh,  you \n got  to  go  on  the  wrong  side. \n I  can  just  hear  so  many  YouTubers \n voices.  It's  like  all  of  UK  YouTubers \n call \n back.  Arthur,  they've  just  disappeared. \n We're  going  the  right  way.  Another \n cameraman  walked  past  me  and  didn't  put \n his  camera  out. \n I  just  don't  know  anymore.  Four  tires. \n Four  tires.  What  would  that  be  around \n London  Bridge?  Or  is  that  too  far  east \n now?  I  kind  of  want  to  make  a  break  for \n it,  but  there's  just  too  many  people \n about,  right,  there's  so  many.  It's  too \n big.  A  break  will  end  the  video.  Once \n everyone's  gone  like  left  at  me  or \n something.  Let's  go  on  the  front  and  let \n the  people  see  me  now  this  is \n hilar \n [ __ ]  batch  just  takes  me  what  he  say \n where  are  you \n I'm  wondering  if  we  need  to  start \n getting  meticulous  what  is  it  like  pick \n a  like  [ __ ]  detailed  like  pick  an \n alley  and  look  at  under  the  bins  but \n that's  why  line  bikes  are  bad  for  that \n no  it's  not  a  oh  so  we'll  look  in  the \n bins  off  the  bike  we  I'm  trying  this \n relationship  starting  to  fall  apart. \n Look,  mate,  you're  getting  too  big  for \n your  boots.  Oh,  really?  You  need  to \n remember  who  had  the  first  boxing  match \n on  YouTube,  mate.  [ __ ]  completely \n irrelevant.  No  one  knows. \n Nothing  to  do  with  boxing  going \n on.  I'm  starting  to  go  crazy  now. \n Starting  to  lose  my  mind,  bro.  I'm \n starting  to  go  crazy.  We've  been  here, \n bro.  Well,  we've  been  everywhere  down \n this  river.  I've  been  here,  bro.  At \n least  our  friends  are  getting  money \n today  as  a  decoy. \n I  don't  care  for  the  money.  Harry  Harry \n could  die  today.  There's  not  one  blue \n hoodie  that  I  would  want  to  rescue \n today.  I've  just  got  a  random  phone \n number.  Head  in  the  direction  set  by  WY. \n What  the  [ __ ]  does  that  mean?  W  East \n London,  man.  There  you  go.  East  London. \n East.  I  think  we  get  on  a  bike  and  ride \n towards  that  black  bit  because  why \n haven't  they  locked  us  off?  Okay,  we've \n decided  we're  going  to  make  a  break  for \n it.  It's  too  hot  here.  It's  too  bad. \n We're  going  to  try  and  get  some  balls \n right  there.  Climb.  No.  Go  right.  Go \n right.  Go  right.  Go  right.  Go  right.  Go \n right.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Simon,  this  way. \n Simon.  Simon.  This  way.  Hurry \n up. \n Okay.  [ __ ] \n [ __ ]  Make  a  break.  Make  a \n break.  Nice. \n Yes.  Can  we  go  around  here?  Can  we  go \n this \n way?  Can  we  go  that  way?  Yes.  There's  no \n path.  This  here  in  the  path,  Harry.  It \n is  up  here.  We're  in  the \n parkour. \n Yeah.  Oh  jeez.  All right.  I'll  give  it  a \n minute. \n Okay.  Circle  shrinkage \n four. \n Okay.  The  river  is  still  in.  Black  fry \n bridge \n is  on  top  of  down  there.  We're  on  top  of \n that  bridge.  We've  been  on  top  of  him. \n We've  been  on  top  of  him  for  ages  and  we \n can't  [ __ ]  find  it.  Simon  and  Toby \n got  him  instantly.  We  got  out  of the \n bush.  Okay.  So,  where  do  we  go?  There's \n so  many  voices  around.  Where  do  we  go? \n My  next  stop  is  going  to  be  some  pools. \n Should  we  go  some  pools?  Yeah,  we'll \n follow  you.  I  don't  know  where  I'm \n going.  Oh  jeez.  Do  we  We  should  tell \n Josh.  Oh,  they  can  see  us,  right?  Yeah. \n Oh  my \n god.  I  keep  Wait,  this  is  where  it  gets \n intense \n now.  Lean  it  back.  This  way.  This  way. \n This  way.  This  way.  This  way.  That \n way.  Oh,  Jesus. \n Someone's  just  going  to  see  three  like \n this.  This  is  so  funny.  Lane  Hall  was \n historically  a  fish  market  as  well.  It's \n the  strongest  link.  Oh,  is  that  in  the \n zone?  Oh,  it's  almost  2:00  in  the \n [ __ ]  time.  Yeah,  this  is  it,  man.  I \n can  feel  it.  We've  had  our  ups,  we've \n had  our  downs,  but  now  we're  about  to \n have  Harry.  [ __ ]  me.  Oh,  you  are  moving. \n Moving. \n Oh  my  god.  Oh  my  god.  Oh  my  god.  Oh  my \n god.  Who  is  it?  I  don't  think  it's  them. \n I  don't  think  it's  them. \n Did  they  see  us?  I  don't  know.  But  we're \n three  blue  three  blue  on  your  right \n somewhere.  This  way.  This  way.  This  way. \n Guys  running.  This  is  more  suspicious. \n Oh  my  god.  Oh  my \n god.  Okay.  So,  James  Marriott  looking \n around  the  corner  like,  \"Oh  my  god.\"  All \n right.  Where  now?  Across  if  we  can.  Oh, \n mate.  My  legs  are  seized  up.  I've  been \n sat  for  so  long.  All  right.  I  did  not \n wear  running  gear.  This  is a  garage \n wife.  We're  in  treacherous  territory \n here. \n Listen  up,  decoy.  I'm  trying  to  get  out \n of  your  way.  Listen  up,  decoy.  Take  us \n to  your  leader.  I'm  going  to  throw  you \n in  the  river  if  you  don't  tell  me \n something.  Take  us  to  your  leader.  I \n don't  know  where  he  is.  Like,  I  actually \n don't.  But  I  know  a  bunch  of  people  who \n are.  Yeah.  Everyone's  here.  Yeah.  Loaden \n Hall  Market,  mate.  A  Harry  got  you. \n Harry,  we  got  your  ass.  Every  Yeah,  we \n need  to  be  thorough  here,  don't  we? \n Check  every \n little  gap.  Harry, \n Harry,  Harry,  Harry,  Harry. \n We  made  a  break  through.  We  made  We \n heard  we  heard  so  many  voices  around  the \n bush  and  we  just  run  out.  We  just  legged \n it.  If  you  make  a  run  for  it  up  towards \n uh  Bank  Station,  you're  good.  There's  no \n one  in  that  direction  right  now.  We're \n at  Bank  Station.  Yeah,  we're  at  Bank \n Station.  No,  no,  no,  no.  We  know  like \n Bankwell  and  Ned  is  obviously  that  that \n side  of  Bank  Station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. \n Okay.  Well,  we're  going to  go  towards \n some  pools.  That's  the  next  plan.  Is \n that  all  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're  good. \n You're  good.  All right.  Cool.  All right. \n Mission  accomplished.  I  don't  get  I \n don't  get  how  they  kept  going  to  that \n location,  bro.  We  We  literally  just \n going  to  go  through  that.  Uh  yeah.  Yeah, \n sure.  Yeah.  I  don't  know  how  they  didn't \n f  Yeah.  I  don't  know  how  they  didn't \n find  us,  mate.  All  right.  See  you  in  a \n bit.  See  you. \n Yeah.  Have  you  seen  Harry?  We  saw  him \n running  up  there.  Many  are  um  over \n there.  Did  you  say  Roshaw?  Yeah.  Yeah. \n We've  been  seeing  you  all  day.  That  is \n them  all  up  there.  Look.  No,  but  that's \n not  Harry  though,  is  it?  Yeah.  No,  look. \n Many  are  Harry.  And  so  I  saw  I  saw  his \n face.  I  saw  his  face  genuinely.  Which \n direction  was  it?  Look  that  way.  Right \n over  that  way.  Thank  you.  Oh,  sorry.  I'm \n wandering  off. \n How  far?  Uh  not  that  far.  Literally  like \n 20  seconds  ago.  Okay.  Right.  Thank  you \n guys  so  much.  Cheers,  guys.  Should  we \n get  on  the  bikes?  We  can  be  quicker  on \n the  bikes  before  that  wasn't  even  James \n Marriott.  I  saw  I  think  it  was  a  random \n guy.  No,  the  hoodie  was  like  this.  It \n was  definitely  this  hoodie.  Are  you \n sure?  It  might  have  been  a  Cuz  it  looked \n like  a  jacket  to  me.  It  didn't  even  look \n like  a  hoodie.  No,  no,  no.  So,  maybe  I \n was  looking  at  the  wrong  person.  It'll \n be  so  funny  when  the  next  circle  shrink \n is  like  doesn't  include  the  river. \n They're  going  to  be  like,  \"What  the \n [ __ ]  Could  he  be  under  the  subway?\"  No, \n I  don't  think  so.  But  he  could.  You \n never  know.  Why  you  might  What  do  you \n mean  why?  He's  hiding.  No  sign  of  him \n that  way.  Crossing.  I  want  death.  Going \n to  [ __ ]  shoot  myself.  New  shrinkage \n inbound  and  new  challenge  inbound.  Look, \n we'll  just  cycle  up  here, \n mate.  Oh  my  god.  Have  I  just  busted  a \n tire?  No.  All  right,  let's  carry  our \n bikes  up.  Oh,  some  sort  of  [ __ ]  high \n rocks.  Feel  like  the  just  got  a  dead  leg \n off  them.  [ __ ]  hell.  How's  he  doing \n that?  What's  he  even  grabbing \n onto?  What?  A  cameraman  trying  to  not \n pull  his  weight,  mate.  He's  got  a \n camera.  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah,  I'll  come  grab \n the  camera  off  you,  bro.  No  problem, \n bro.  Now  I  got  your  back,  man.  Got  you, \n man.  I  got  you,  bro.  Go  on,  James \n Parker.  Look  at  him.  Beautiful  scale. \n Hi,  Theo.  Um,  just  to  let  you  know,  we \n are  where  Martin  Luther  King  gave  a \n sermon  in  1964.  So,  good  luck.  I  love \n this  part  of  London.  All  the  old \n buildings.  It  is  nice. \n It's  got  to  be  around  when  like  the  fire \n emoji.  Five  London  bank.  The  bank  bank \n emoji  bank \n like  bloody  hell.  Hey  B,  let  me  look  at \n where  we  are,  mate.  I'm  at  wit  end  to  be \n quite  frank.  No,  fully  witsy.  I  don't \n want  to  get  crude,  but  I'm  ticked  off. \n We're  smack  bang  in  the  middle  of  the \n map  right  now.  All right,  let's  look \n around \n here.  Decoy.  More  like  decoy.  New \n shrinkage  and  new  challenge.  Look,  look, \n looks  looks  new  challenge.  Quick.  Yeah. \n Yeah.  Yeah.  He's  ting.  Uh,  we're  in  the \n middle  of  nowhere.  There's  a  bridge \n there  as  well.  What  is  it?  First  team  to \n get  on  a  tube  carriage. \n Uh,  we  ain't  going  to  do  that. \n First  team  to  get  on  a  tube  carriage. \n Should  we  try  and  do  it  now?  No.  Anyone \n doing  it?  No  one's  doing  it. \n Arthur,  we  got  to  get  on  the  tube.  Just \n go  to  go  to  Monument  Tube.  I'll  catch  up \n with  you.  It's  the  next  challenge  and  I \n don't  think  anyone's  going  to  do  it. \n Wait,  what  a  beautiful  day.  I  I  wouldn't \n have  known. \n All right,  St. \n Paul's,  where  are  you?  You  beautiful \n building.  I  feel  like  we  shouldn't  have \n walked  this  far.  No,  it's  it's  that  was \n quite  a  way.  Yeah,  it's  up  here.  I  think \n this  is  We're  approaching  the  end  game. \n Surely  though,  right?  Surely  the \n circle's  going  to  shrink  to  like  just \n rounds  and  pools  and  we're  going  to  be \n racing  for  it.  He  could  shrink.  Oh.  Oh. \n Oh.  Jamie  and  Daniel  on  your  left.  Jamie \n and  Daniel  on  your  left  at  the  other \n side  of  the  road.  Hide  behind  the  thing. \n They're  literally  the  other  side  of \n this.  They're  the  other  side  of  this. \n Oh,  yes.  I  see  him.  They're  literally \n there.  They're  going  straight  past.  Oh, \n look.  They  gone  down  there.  Oh.  Oh  my \n god.  Oh  my  god.  Oh  my  god.  Stop. \n No.  Everyone  shut  up.  Shut  up.  Shut  up. \n Shut  up.  Oh  my  god.  How  do  they  not  see \n her?  Jamie's  going to  beat  himself  up \n about  that.  But  that  was  that  was  a  10 \n grand  mistake  possibly.  Oh  [ __ ]  Yeah. \n Hoben's  wiped  off.  We'll  just  take  a \n picture.  Yeah.  And  then  step  off.  Yeah. \n Both  of  us.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep. \n Now,  let's  get  in  the  center  and  get  a \n direction. \n Oh,  someone  done  it.  Someone  done  it. \n Someone  done  it. \n This  way,  I  think.  Wait,  did  we  get  it? \n No,  we  won  it.  Yeah.  Yeah. \n Who  the  hell  is  this?  It's  a  decoy.  It's \n a  decoy.  Where  you  guys  going?  Yeah. \n Huh?  Batch.  Where  you  going?  Don't  worry \n about  it.  No,  we've  got  the  tube \n picture.  We're  going  for  the  tube,  mate. \n Why  don't  you  check  the  zone,  buddy?  Why \n is  he  getting  on  the  tube?  Cuz  he's \n saying  you  check  the  zone.  They're \n right.  We  need  to  go.  We  need  to  just \n get  a  stop  away.  It'll  be  quicker  to  go \n there.  No,  it  won't  it  won't.  What's  up? \n Uh,  no.  I  thought \n the  new  zone's  in.  The  river's  not  in. \n The  river.  The  river's  not  in.  It's  a \n bit  up  from  the  river.  Ah,  Black  Fries \n Bridge,  which  is  I'm  telling  you,  it's \n near  West  and  Toby.  Disappeared.  We've \n been  led  astray.  Let's \n go.  Let's  go. \n We've  had  a  new  circle.  It's  It's  like \n the  Black  Friars  area,  mate.  We're \n basically  smack  banging  Black  Fridays. \n Are  we?  I  hope  we  run  into  some  other \n teams.  I'm  starting  to  feel  just  like  a \n bit.  Yeah,  we're  a  bit  outcasted, \n disheartened,  you  know.  Surely \n everyone's  experiencing  the  exact  same \n thing  as  us,  though.  M.  This  is  This  is \n This  is  what  This  is  beautiful.  Yeah.  We \n can't  actually  go  into  pool.  There's  a \n couple  benches  on  other  side  of  this. \n think  like  when  you're  in  here  they \n might  I  think  let's  just  have  a  walk \n around  and  see.  I  think  he's  uh \n southwest  of  St.  Paul.  That's  where \n we've  never  been.  Yeah.  All  right,  let's \n get  going.  Let's  try  again. \n This  just  feels  too  easy  now.  But  at \n this  point,  it  does  need  to  be  easy. \n We've  we've  shown  that  no  one  can  find \n us.  No  one  can  find  us.  The  zone's \n trunk.  Well,  so  you  got  to  stick  with  us \n now  anyway.  Yeah.  Hey,  we're  a  team  now. \n Would  you  be  willing  to  do  7030  split? \n You  guys  had  the  zone  in  the  chat  and \n you  had  no  idea.  No,  but  we  were  doing \n the  challenge  though.  Oh  my  god.  All \n previous  clues  are  now  invalid.  The \n hider  has  moved  somewhere  in  this  zone. \n Knew  it.  And  we  got  Simon  sent  me  a \n voice  note  as  well.  Hi.  Um,  just  to  let \n you  know, \n what  did  he  say?  [ __ ]  That's  where  he \n said  before.  St.  Paul's  isn't  in  the \n zone,  is  it?  He  is  not  in  St.  Paul's. \n It's  not  the  zone  anymore.  And  he \n backfires.  Simon's  where  Martin  Luther \n King  did  his  speech,  which  was  St. \n Paul's.  Wait,  all  previous  clues  are  now \n invalid.  The  hiders  have  moved  somewhere \n in  this  zone.  Okay,  that's  good  to  know. \n Okay,  I  really  think  we  should  bike. \n Blue  hoodie.  Blue  hoodie.  There's  quite \n a  lot  of  area  that  way.  Should  we  give \n it  a  go?  Garlic  Hill.  If  they're  moving, \n we're  cooked.  I  reckon  they're  moving, \n you  know,  cuz  there's  a  few  of  them, \n man.  Yeah,  we're  cooked.  Oh,  we  are \n fraud.  We're  cooked.  But  all  the  clues  I \n previously  are  invalid,  so  maybe  he's \n gone  back  there,  brother.  He's  moved. \n And  Simon  said  he's  there.  Oh,  Simon \n wouldn't  be  telling  us  the  truth.  Let's \n be  real.  But  we've  been  here.  Okay,  I \n have  a  potential  theory.  A  few  people \n have  found  Harry.  Yeah.  And  they've \n decided  to  move.  And  I  think  they've \n decided  to  move  to  the  furthest  point  of \n the  zone.  like  all  the  way  in  the  bottom \n left. \n Yeah,  I  remember  this  place  as  well.  Why \n do  I  remember  this  place? \n Hold  on.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh  my  god.  Yes. \n Yes.  Oh  my  god.  We've  been  found \n the  worst  people,  you  know,  just  you \n guaranteed  yourselves  money.  Yes. \n Lovely.  But  if  the  next  one  fin  Ethan \n and  Vic  and  you  two  split  the  entire \n prize.  Oh,  so  we  want  Ethan  and  Vic. \n Yeah,  but  you  can't  help  them.  We  bumped \n into  a  couple  people  that  took  a  video \n of  you  three  together.  We  saw  Toby  and \n Simon.  I  was  like,  \"Haven't  seen  Harry.\" \n He's  like, \"No,  no,  that's  his  face.\" \n Vic,  where  did  you  stop \n getting  a  hug? \n lads.  I'm  going to  sit  in  this  little \n cubby  hole  here.  We  should  sit  at least \n a  little  bit  further  away  now.  Yeah. \n Should  we  all  hide  then?  No,  it  doesn't \n really.  No,  you  don't  have  to  hide.  You \n can  sit  there  so  they  don't  see  me \n immediately.  There  we  go.  Well,  there's \n Will  and  James. \n Simon  and \n Toby. \n What?  Say  someone  behind  the \n scenic. \n Ethan  seen  us. \n Oh  my  god.  Oh  my  god. \n [ __ ]  come. \n Yes.  Yes.  Oh  my  god.  Where  is  he?  You \n have  to  find  Harry.  Oh,  [ __ ]  He's  in \n the  corner. \n There  was  a  bunch  of  bushes  and  you \n walked  up  a  staircase  to  look  behind \n some  stuff.  Yeah,  we  were  in  the  bushes. \n Well,  they  actually  they  haven't  found \n me  yet.  They  did.  They  pointed  at  you, \n bastard.  Oh,  you  know,  I  don't  care.  I'm \n just  happy  to  be  here  and  we  didn't \n lose.  You  guys  get  You  got  10  grand \n each. \n This  is  going  to  be \n so \n money.  Money. \n Hello.  It's  quite  cozier  actually. \n I  can't  have  my  feel.  We're  so  close. \n Oh,  looks.  Oh,  yeah.  Well,  we  will. \n Let's  celebrate  with  them  as  if  they've \n won  because  if  they  if  half  of  the  time \n Oh,  [ __ ]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. \n Oh,  no.  You  lot  are  sick  in  the  head. \n No. \n Oh,  no.  Randy,  you  don't  have  to  come \n in.  I'll  be  honest.  You  could  you  could \n just  maybe  go.  He's  not  here.  You  You \n found  him.  No,  they  kept  saying  you \n found  him.  Wait,  he's  not  here.  Why  are \n you  lot  just  chilling  here  then?  No,  no, \n no.  He's  not.  He's  Why  are  you  lot  just \n chilling  here  then?  Because  we  want  to \n die.  That's  why.  Call \n and  weirdly  quiet.  No,  we've  just  given \n up.  Okay.  We've  had  a  meal.  I  think  had \n a  five,  guys.  But  I  haven't  eaten.  We're \n going to  go  sushi.  Wait,  you  lot  just \n given  up.  Yes.  What's  the  point?  Oh,  by \n the way,  my  batteries  all  batter  is \n gone.  One  one  gave  me  also.  Oh  [ __ ] \n Oh  [ __ ]  Yeah,  Bradley,  we  did  it. \n Yeah,  she's  there.  One  thing  Oh  my  god, \n you  almost  got  me.  One  thing  I  want  to \n point  out.  How  many  side  men  do  you \n count?  Four.  We  lost.  You  missed  the \n money  by  5  minutes. \n I  got  the  go,  bro.  Oh.  Oh  my  god.  Lux. \n Lux.  Lux.  It  gets  worse.  Come  here.  Come \n here.  You  went  out  by  the  river.  You \n walked  up  the  stairs.  You  parked  your \n bike  and  someone  said,  \"You  can't  park \n there.\"  And  you  were  like, \"Oh,  no.  No. \n I'm  just  dropping  it  off  for  one \n second.\"  Or  something  like  that.  And \n then  you  walked  up  a  staircase  to  look \n at  nothing.  There  was  a  bunch  of  bushes \n right  by  the  riverside.  Oh  my  god,  we \n were  in  that  bush.  How  you  feeling, \n Danny?  The  the  hope  is  slowly  going  away \n to  be  honest  with  you.  I  don't  think \n it's  going  to  happen  anymore,  but  we \n stay  positive  spirit. \n Have  you  left  the  line  bike  shell? \n You've  been  on  them  all  time.  No,  we're \n staying  on  these  bad  boys.  He's  got  a \n little  congregation,  little \n conglomerate.  I  don't  like  that.  The \n evil  crew.  They're  the  evil  crew.  tell \n them  your  secrets.  They  walk  off  and \n they  don't  tell  you  nothing.  What  the \n [ __ ]  are  we  doing?  I  know.  Do  you  know \n worst  bit  as  well  is  that  bloody  Simon \n Mini  M's  little  smug  face  is  just  going \n to  be  there  as  well.  Just  Oh,  bro.  Did \n you  not  get  that  hint?
