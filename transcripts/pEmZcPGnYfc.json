  "transcript": "this  $2,500  basketball  is  the  most  viral \n 3D  print  on  the  internet  but  try  to  make \n it  yourself  and  everyone  will  tell  you \n don't  ever  expect  it  to  bounce  but  if  I \n cared  what  other  people  thought  I \n wouldn't  be  an  X  fan  and  I  wouldn't  be  a \n Mets  fan  so  we  gave  ourselves  30  days  to \n try  and  print  our  own  ball  and  after \n trying  failing  and  trying  again  we  ended \n up  with  seven  unhinged  Tech  products \n including  a  basketball  that  might \n actually \n bounce  so  yeah  we  started  with  two \n prints  that  are  pretty \n straightforward  so  this  is  a  speaker  for \n your  iPhone  that  we  made  here  in  the \n studio  and  it  only  took  about  2  hours  to \n print  so  in  a  typical  workday  you  can \n have  four  of  these  so  the  reason  we \n started  with  this  one  was  because  of  the \n multi  material  Alex  and  I  were  really \n excited  to  to  get  our  hands  on  that  so \n this  was  one  of  our  first  prints  that  we \n did  when  we  decided  to  test  the  real \n functionality  of  this  Beast  of  a  printer \n that  we  have  you  can  see  it's  got  five \n spools  on  it  most  have  one  so  normally \n when  you're  printing  something  with \n multiple  materials  if  you  only  have  like \n what  we  were  using  before  which  is  just \n one  nozzle  you  kind  of  have  to  babysit \n the  thing  and  then  like  pause  the  print \n change  the  filament  extrude  the  little  G \n and  make  sure  that  it's  clean  and  good \n to  go  then  like  resume  and  go  back  and \n forth  yeah  so  I  think  we  should  actually \n see  how  this  sounds  so  let's  press \n play  this  is \n regular  sounds  pretty  good  and  it  sounds \n not  good \n now  obviously  it's  you  can't  even  hear \n this  right  now  so  let's  see  what  would \n happen  if  you  put  in  the  speaker  oh \n that's  so \n loud  what  I  can't  even  hear  what  you're \n saying  anymore  oh  now  I  hear  you  part  oh \n I  mean  it  does  it  definitely  I  didn't \n catch  any  of  that  what  you  say  oh  you  it \n is  so  loud  I  can't  even  hear  myself \n think  it's  really  so  there's  a  very \n expensive  phone  out  there  that  costs \n multiple  thousands  of  dollars  but  you \n can't  get  it  in  this  country  just  yet \n Marquez  has  one  because  he's  Marquez  the \n rest  of  have  to  make  do \n so  this  was  our  solution  three  times  the \n cameras  three  times  the  processing  power \n what  do  you  think  this  solves  so  many \n problems  and  creates  so  many  more  but  if \n you're  like  you  know  into  stons  or  like \n you  know  Finance  or  something  that  would \n require  you  having  three  phones  at  once \n you're  like  a  one  of  those  ticket  sell \n like  resell  bot  guys  this  is  really \n going  to  allow  you  to  be  productive  in \n so  many  ways  you  probably  shouldn't  be \n this  thing  you  can  actually  download \n right  now  and  print  yourself  if  you  want \n shout  out  to  Alex  we'll  link  his  stuff \n in  the  description  below  he's  the \n designer  that  came  up  with  this  whole \n beautiful  monstrous  design  if  you  have \n three  pixel  phones  at  home  that  you  want \n to  put  on  now  that  I  was  more \n comfortable  with  the  prusia  XL  and  it \n gotten  some  prints  under  my  belt  my  next \n thought  was  to  print  something  bigger \n this  is  the  stim  station  you  can't  see \n it  right  now  they'll  probably  put  it  up \n on  the  screen  but  miles  is  watching \n Subway  Surfers  Minecraft  Edition  this  is \n a  Roblox  speedrun  a  Roblox  speed  I  put \n it  on  2x  speed  within  the  YouTube  player \n because  Jen  Z  man  what  are  you  going  to \n do  good  Lord  you  know  you  can  watch \n waveform  and  Studio  channel  can  watch \n the  studio  Channel  and  like  And \n subscribe  that  would  be  hitting  the  like \n button  hitting  that  Bell  so  anyway  this \n is  printed  with  pla  but  as  you  can  see \n here  there's  still  some  like  guck  around \n the  edges  that  is  because  the  supports \n and  the  actual  thing  itself  was  made  of \n the  same  material  meaning  that  it's \n harder  to  scrape  it  off  at  the  end \n of  this  is  this  was  the  print  where  I \n learned  about  organic  supports  for  the \n first  time  this  is  not  one  that  actually \n went  on  this  but  just  to  illustrate  so \n organic  supports  look  like  a  tree  which \n is  why  they're  called  organic  it'll  just \n hold  it  up  kind  of  like  this  and  that \n way  when  you're  done  they  just  go  Boop \n but  like  we  spoke  about  earlier  having \n them  made  of  the  same  material  makes  it \n a  little  bit  harder  to  scrape  off  so  we \n kind  of  left  this  here  for  educational \n purposes  because  you  know  we  we  normally \n have  masterful  prints  so  if  you  have  a \n printer  unlike  this  one  like  the  one  we \n used  to  have  that  doesn't  print  in \n multiple  materials  you  might  have  a  lot \n of  this  to  deal  with  on  top  of  the  fact \n that  these  are  considered  organic  uh \n they're  actually  the  most  uh  filament \n efficient  as  well  so  inside  of  these \n I'll  just  do  this  live  Hollow  which  is \n nice  so  they're  they're  completely \n Hollow  on  the \n inside  just \n yeah  so  with  our  necks  in  pain  and  our \n eyes  slowly  dripping  from  from  our \n skulls  I  thought  the  stim  station  was  a \n win  and  I  was  pretty  confident  I  could \n find  a  way  to  print  supports  for  the \n basketball  and  then  our  designer  friend \n Alex  sent  us  a  link  to  something  very \n special  a  special  bouncy  filament  that's \n easy  to  set  up  in  print  and  Squishy  like \n a  basketball  but  before  using  this  new \n filament  to  print  my  white  whale  I \n figured  I'd  try  printing  a  white \n crocodile  can  we  do  like  a  fake  cut \n where  you  throw  it  towards  my \n foot \n what  the \n hell  sorry  I  didn't  see  you  there  I  just \n wearing  my  3D  printed  Croc  I  am  pretty \n impressed  by  just  the  like  the \n flexibility  of  it  like  the  bottom  is  a \n squishy  sole  which  I  would  not  think  of \n when  I  think  of  3D  printing  so  fun  fact \n this  is  the  material  that  I  wanted  to \n print  the  basketball  out  of  and  I  was \n like  well  I  need  to  make  sure  that  it  is \n flexible  cuz  if  you  watch  again  my \n sensei's  video  on  the  3D  printed \n basketball  Joel  so  what  Joel  found  when \n he  was  printing  was  that  the  flexible \n one  was  too  flexible  it  was  too  tensile \n so  because  there  was  too  little  energy \n return  it  was  absorbing  too  much  of  the \n like  a  deflated  basketball  almost  right \n right  with  the  standard  rigid  material \n the  pla  he  bounced  it  and  it  did  bounce \n but  then  he  bounced  it  a  second  time  and \n it  cracked  in  half  like  an  egg  so  then \n in  doing  some  research  and  talking  to \n Alex  who  designed  our  other  very  fun \n products  he  put  us  on  to  this  filament \n the  selling  point  is  that  it's  pla  which \n is  traditionally  the  original  material \n but  somehow  it  is  more  bouncy  and  more \n tensile  so  it's  sort  of  like  a  fusion \n material  so  for  the  Croc  how  long  do  you \n think  that  took  to  print  I  would  guess \n between  like  15  and  24  hours  based  on  my \n experience  with  similarly \n sized  objects  it  actually  took  20  hours \n for  one  shoe  but  think  about  it  this  way \n right  is  that  faster  than  how  long  it \n would  take  to  one  day  ship  a  pair  of \n Crocs  from  we  it  no  because  I  would  need \n two  I  could  print \n two  you  can  print  a  shoe  with  this \n material  it's  squishy  it  bounces  good  I \n felt  pretty  confident  that  it  could  work \n for  a  basketball  but  of  course  there's \n still  more  work  to  do  before  attempting \n my  Holy  Grail  of  Prince  I  figured  I'd \n take  another  couple  easy  wins  a  new \n friend  Scott  eug  Jan  had  kindly  lent  us \n some  of  his  files  to  try  printing  a \n beautiful  iPhone  dock  and  his  very  fun \n Macintosh  mini  print \n this  one  is  actually  a  dock  for  the \n iPhone  that  is  supposed  to  act  like  an \n alarm  clock  kind  of  thing  and  it  charges \n your  phone  it  charges  your  airpods \n everything  like  that  we  couldn't  get  it \n to  work  for  this  guy  because  the  infill \n is  a  little  too  squishy  so  we  decided  to \n try  it  with  a  different  infill  this  one \n this  one  after  this  one  failed  I  was \n like  man  I  don't  want  to  run  out  of \n filament  so  this  pattern  I  thought  would \n save  filament  But  ultimately  ran  into \n some  sort  of  issue  again  where  it  just \n was  wasn't  able  to  finish  still  too \n squishy  though  so  we \n started  that  is  broken  so  then  we  did \n this  one  which  actually  worked  out \n perfectly  this  support  uh  but  for  some \n reason  halfway  through  it  stopped  so \n this  is  the  other  half  which  we  have  to \n glue  on  and  then  it's  a  perfect \n product  we  did  this  one  and  then  this \n one  was  just  how  Scott  did  it  himself  I \n think  very  similar  to  to  this  print  he \n might  have  picked  this  pattern  because \n it  looks  cooler  on  video  when  you're \n printing  a  time  lapse  actually  this  is \n like  probably  the  only  thing  of \n everything  we've  checked  out  today  that \n I  would  actually  use  and  it's  the  one \n that  keeps  cursing  us  with  uh  failed \n prints  naturally  um  it's  really  cool \n thankfully  we  could  just  get  it  from \n Scott  because  he  also  sells  them  at  his \n store  so  check  that  out  oh  yeah  oh  with \n a  heavy  drop  oh  it's  not  that  bad  you \n could  walk  into  a  Starbucks  with  this \n yeah  you  can  walk  into  a  Starbucks  with \n this  I  don't  I  don't  know  if  I'm  doing \n that  this  is  the  Macintosh  mini  Harper \n this  was  made  by  our  friend  Scott  who \n lent  us  his  design  to  print  ourselves \n this  is  a  M2  Mac  Mini  underneath  that \n slots  in  really  nicely  and  plugs  into  an \n external  power  bank  which  is  in  a  drawer \n that  slides  into  the  back  and  then  it  is \n an  iPad  Mini  up  front  that  runs  as  the \n display  for  this  thus  giving  you  a \n little  baby  computer  I  can't  imagine \n that  doing  this  at  a  desk  all  day  like \n with  this  this  insane  scaling  mhm  is  not \n going  to  have  detrimental  effects  on \n your  eyesight  like  your  eyes  are  already \n gone  you've  been  staring  at  a  screen \n since  you  were  born  it's  fine  I  feel \n like  if  you  want  to  show  people  how  good \n you  are  at  3D  printing  there's  only  one \n thing  you  need  which \n is  what  if  you  printed  cheeked  up  Fred \n the  Frog  into  this  design  would  that \n make  it  better  for  you  like  if  the \n handle  was  like  on  the  back  of  his  hat \n you  know  what  I'm  sold  we  have  a  file \n for  Fred  right  we  have  a  file  for  this \n we  could  theoretically  combine  the  two \n right  as  much  as  we  wanted  to  keep \n messing  around  we  were  running  out  of \n time  to  print  this  basketball  so  we  left \n the  printer  running  for  60  hours  and \n when  we  came  back  something  pretty \n special  was  waiting  for \n us  so  this  all  needs  to  get  trimmed \n off  and  the  bottom  may  be  looking  a \n little  rough  but  if  I'm  careful \n rest  this  feels  pretty  good  it  was  time \n to  give  this  bad  boy  its  first \n bounce \n bounces  I  think  it \n worked  let's  go  Qui \n as  it  looks  so  good  so  much  of  the \n detail  is  similar  and  I  think  what  we \n found  is  the  only  difference  is  that \n like  a  downward  bounce  is  a  little \n different  but  a  drop  is  almost  identical \n which  is  crazy  that  you  can  just  do  that \n at  home  mhm  for  $2,500  or  about \n 30  full  disclosure  my  basketball  broke \n after  about  a  week  of  nobody  being  able \n to  keep  their  hands  off  it  and  bouncing \n it  a  million  times  on  our  hard  concrete \n floor  at  the  studio  and  I'm  a  little \n bummed  that  the  culmination  of  my \n efforts  now  has  a  big  old  crack  in  it \n but  that's  kind  of  the  perfect \n representation  of  what  this  whole \n process  was  and  is  when  it  comes  to  3D \n printing  Perfection  is  earned  not  given \n so  we're  going  back  to  the  drawing  board \n to  make  a  perfect  3D  printed \n indestructible  ball  that  will  never \n break  subscribe  if  you  want  to  see  that \n process  so  thank  you  to  Scott  and  Alex \n for  providing  us  with  these  really  cool \n designs  that  we  are  able  to  print  and \n giving  us  tips  and  expertise  on  how  to \n make  some  of  this  stuff  come  to  life \n also  thank  you  to  Joel  for  coming  into \n the  studio  and  teaching  Alex  and  I  how \n to  set  this  up  and  what  to  do  with  it  uh \n check  out  his  video  for  everything \n behind  the  scenes  linked  below  if  this \n video  gets  880,000  likes  I  will  make  a \n version  of  Fred  the  frog  that  is  three \n times  bigger",
