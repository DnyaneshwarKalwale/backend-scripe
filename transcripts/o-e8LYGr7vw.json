All  you  actually  need  to  do \n is  stop  procrastinating  and  become  more \n productive.  Social  media  has  over \n complicated  the  idea  of  productivity. \n From  the  long  aesthetic  morning  routines \n that  feel  unattainable  to  the  millions \n of  tools  and  tactics  that  fail  you \n before  you  even  start  using  them.  I  was \n able  to  finish  a  master's  degree  while \n building  a  six-figure  business,  get  my \n dream  body,  and  even  get  to  work  with  my \n dream  brands  last  year.  And  this  year,  I \n want  you  to  do  the  same.  So,  I'm  going \n to  lay  out  the  habits  I've  taken  away \n from  the  most  amazing  and  highly \n intelligent  women  I've  been  around  and \n the  ones  that  I  admire  online  because \n success  leaves  clues  and  I've  collected \n the  most  actionable  ones  for  you  to \n actually  do  this  year.  First  things \n first,  highly  intelligent  women  don't \n let  life  happen  to  them.  They  make  it \n happen  for  them.  The  need  you  have  for \n productivity  comes  from  a  deep  desire  to \n be  who  you  know  that  you  can  be.  trying \n to  be  more  productive  so  you  can \n graduate  with  honors  and  build  your \n dream  career.  Trying  to  be  more \n productive  so  you  can  finish  work  and \n get  your  dream  physique  or  trying  to  be \n more  productive  so  you  can  work  more  and \n make  more  money.  You  can  do  all  of  it \n but  you  need  to  know  why  otherwise  you \n will  fail.  The  why  doesn't  need  to  be \n big  and  you  don't  need  to  want  to  become \n the  biggest  and  most  famous  person  but \n you  can  try  and  be  the  best  person  for \n yourself.  And  to  figure  out  what  that \n even  is  to  you,  you  need  to  start  doing \n more  things  that  lead  you  to  figure  out \n what  that  is.  When  I  started  my \n self-improvement  journey,  all  I  wanted \n was  to  prove  to  myself  I  could  do  it. \n And  then  to  prove  to  everyone  else  I \n could  do  it.  It  started  by  finishing \n university.  Then  that  led  me  to  starting \n a  business.  Then  that  led  me  to  building \n a  personal  brand  with  hundreds  and \n thousands  of  followers.  But  it  all \n started  with  one  thing.  And  yes,  I  had  a \n massive  ship  on  my  shoulder  trying  to \n prove  everyone  wrong  and  I  did  it.  And \n the  best  thing  ever  is  to  do  the  thing \n that  people  didn't  think  you  could  do. \n And  if  I  was  to  do  it  all  over  again,  I \n would  set  three  main  habits  in  place. \n The  first  one  that  changed  my  life  is \n what  I  decided  to  call  a  quick  win \n morning  routine.  A  routine  that  is  good \n for  my  brain  and  not  just  for  the \n aesthetic  Tik  Tok  videos  that  you  see \n online.  First,  I  needed  to  hack  my \n brain.  And  the  hack  was  understanding \n that  time  is  literally  finite.  You  can't \n buy  it  back.  It's  simply  just  sticking \n away.  Oh,  but  I'm  an  eye  owl.  Or,  oh,  I \n can  only  work  at  X  time  of  the  day,  or \n oh,  I  don't  have  time.  Neither  do  I.  But \n I  made  it  work  because  it  wasn't  going \n to  work  for  me.  I  used  to  pride  myself \n on  being  a  night  owl  and  feeling  so  cool \n for  being  up  late  because  it  helped  my \n creativity.  And  that  reframe  literally \n clocked  me  because  while  I  was  spending \n time  at  2:00  a.m.  working,  I  was  missing \n several  hours  in  the  morning,  I  could  be \n using  to  optimize  all  the  areas  of  my \n life  instead  of  just  one.  Because  the \n time  I  spent  at  night  working,  I  was \n missing  out  on  a  consistent  gym  routine, \n time  with  my  loved  ones,  a  work  schedule \n that  wasn't  24/7,  and  most  importantly, \n time  to  rest,  which  ultimately  led  me  to \n having  this  thing  called  brain  fog \n nearly  every  single  day,  and  I  didn't \n even  know  it.  The  cloudy  thinking,  the \n slow  brain,  the  difficulty  focusing,  it \n isn't  just  being  tired  or  stressed.  It's \n a  complex  neurological  state.  And  if  you \n want  to  be  productive  and  struggling \n because  your  brain  feels  like  there's  a \n 100  different  tabs  open  and  none  of  them \n are  loading,  I  got  you.  In  the  morning, \n you  need  to  focus  on  two  quick  points. \n One  for  your  mental  health  and  one  for \n your  physical  health.  Every  morning,  I \n try  to  get  up  and  get  the  out  of \n the  house,  especially  when  I'm \n completely  demotivated  and  feel  lazy.  I \n noticed  that  I  was  associating  my \n environment  with  laziness,  and  it  would \n manifest  in  how  I  felt.  So  I  either  pack \n my  bag  and  go  to  the  gym  even  if  I'm  not \n doing  anything  and  take  my  laptop  with \n me  to  work.  Even  just  to  walk  there \n literally  helped  me  so  much  because  it \n was  an  immediate  change  in  the \n environment  I  was  in  and  I  had  some \n movement.  And  this  brings  me  back  to \n that  part  in  the  book  Atomic  Habits \n where  he  mentions  the  idea  of  10  minutes \n in  the  gym  is  better  than  10  minutes  on \n the  couch  because  doing  something  is \n better  than  doing  nothing  and  staying \n exactly  where  you  are.  And  look,  this \n isn't  about  an  exercise  routine  and \n doing  pilateses  or  running  10k.  It's \n about  getting  you  out  of  that  pattern  of \n bad  habits  that's  keeping  you  stuck.  Our \n brain  loves  patterns,  but  it  also  loves \n learning  new  ones.  So,  when  you  opt  in \n to  not  hit  snooze  and  instead  get  out  of \n your  house,  you're  creating  a  new \n neuropathway  inside  your  brain.  It's \n crazy  how  quickly  we  can  retrain \n ourselves  from  being  unproductive  to  a \n professional  weapon  in  weeks.  But  you \n need  to  do  the  hard  thing  first  and  do \n it  for  the  first  time  and  second  time. \n Now  the  mental  health  win  for  me  is \n generally  about  getting  dopamine,  but \n the  good  kind.  That  can  be  from  the \n workout  you  do  at  the  gym  or  the  walk  to \n a  cafe.  And  then  that  can  also  be  from \n listening  to  your  favorite  upbeat  music. \n And  then  tell  yourself,  \"Wow,  I  get  to \n enjoy  this  today.  I  get  to  big  brain.\" \n You  have  to  be  like,  \"Yes,  I  get  to  do \n this  thing  I've  been  thinking  about \n doing  for  months.\"  You've  been  desiring \n a  morning  routine.  You've  been  desiring \n more  wealth.  You've  been  desiring  a \n better  body.  Well,  it  all  starts  here. \n And  you  get  to  do  it.  You  don't  have  to \n do  it.  No  one  is  forcing  you.  But  if  you \n want  to  save  yourself  from  an  average \n life,  then  you  get  to  choose  this  path. \n There's  so  many  people  out  there  wishing \n that  they  had  time,  wishing  that  they \n could  move,  wishing  that  they  could  do \n this  thing.  So  remember  that  when  I  was \n so  ill  a  few  months  ago  and  I  couldn't \n move  or  do  anything,  all  I  wanted  was \n one  thing,  my  health,  I  forgot  about  all \n the  other  100  things  in  my  wish  list  and \n just  prayed  I  could  simply  be  healthy. \n Then  and  there,  I  stopped  taking  every \n single  thing  for  granted  because  when \n you're  healthy,  you  want  a  100  things, \n but  when  you're  ill,  you  just  want  one, \n your  health.  So,  my  routine  looks  like \n this  right  now.  5:30  a.m.  I  wake  up. \n 6:00  a.m.  I  go  to  the  gym  or  I  replace \n it  for  work  if  I'm  not  working  out.  Then \n at  7:00  a.m.  I  finish  and  then  I  shower. \n And  then  from  7:00  to  12:00,  it's  mostly \n blocked  for  creative  work.  Then  I  get \n time  to  work  on  urgent  tasks,  take \n calls,  and  focus  on  growing  as  a  human, \n not  a  machine.  This  routine  has  given  me \n so  much  time  back,  and  it  has  helped  me \n stop  chasing  an  endless  to-do  list.  But \n if  you  struggle  to  wake  up  this  early,  I \n have  the  best  trick  I  learned  to  beat \n this.  But  first,  we  need  to  eat  the  fog, \n which  is  a  common  productivity  concept \n to  do  the  hard  tasks  first.  Now,  I \n mentioned  endless  to-do  lists,  and  how \n we're  going  to  be  dealing  with  those  is \n by  using  this  beautiful  concept  I  saw \n from  one  of  my  favorite  Twitter  bros \n called  tactical  anxiety.  It's  a  cheat \n code  for  productivity.  Because  if  you \n work  for  yourself  or  have  full  control \n of  your  own  schedule,  then  time  may \n always  seem  infinite  and  you  keep \n delaying  the  tasks  that  you  need  to  do \n and  ultimately  they  pile  up  and  you \n freeze.  So  the  way  I  started  to \n implement  this  is  that  I  list  every \n single  thing  I  need  to  do  that  seems \n urgent  or  perhaps  needs  doing  at  some \n point  within  the  next  few  weeks.  This  is \n also  known  as  the  Asenhower  matrix.  But \n that  alone  never  worked  for  me  because \n if  you're  a  high  achieving  person  but \n also  a  procrastinator  then  everything  is \n due  yesterday.  And  since  everything  is \n always  due  yesterday  for  me  to  stop \n myself  from  feeling  like  a  shaking \n Chihuahua  first  I  need  to  give  you  a \n harsh  truth.  The  reality  of \n procrastination  is  that  you're  most \n likely  procrastinating  not  because  the \n thing  that  you're  trying  to  do  is  hot, \n but  simply  because  you're  not  good  at  it \n yet,  and  it's  scary.  But  you  need  to \n keep  the  promises  that  you  made  to \n yourself  about  doing  the  thing  that \n you've  been  putting  off  the  most  because \n that  is  how  you're  going  to  rewire  your \n brain  to  think  of  yourself  as  someone \n who  gets  done.  I  took  my  big  scary \n to-do  list  to  the  gym,  worked  out,  and \n then  sat  down,  played  my  entire  schedule \n for  the  day  and  blocked  every  single \n social  media  app  and  even  email,  and \n laid  out  everything  that  I  had  to  do, \n all  the  tasks  that  were  overdue, \n everything  that  I  was  avoiding  and \n simply  just  got  to  work.  I  used  this  app \n called  Opal  on  my  iPhone  and  an  app \n called  Cold  Turkey  on  my  laptop.  Then  I \n sat  at  the  gym  cafe,  locked  my  phone  in \n the  locker  and  went  from  hardest  one  to \n easiest  one  and  refused  to  leave  until  I \n did  all  of  them.  I  did  them  all  in  under \n 5  hours.  The  tasks  weren't  as  hard  as  I \n thought.  I  just  needed  to  have  the  time \n to  think  about  them  instead  of  having \n them  in  a  to-do  list  next  to  all  the \n other  million  other  side  tasks  I  had \n like  buying  groceries.  You  need  to  give \n yourself  a  deadline  and  enforce  it. \n Otherwise,  you'll  never  do  the  thing. \n This  is  how  you  give  yourself  time  to  do \n all  the  remaining  not  so  urgent  tasks \n well  because  honestly  doing  that  every \n single  day  isn't  sustainable  as  the \n quality  of  work  is  100%  compromised.  No \n doubt.  And  yes,  done  is  better  than \n perfect,  but  not  when  you're  trying  to \n be  the  highest  version  of  yourself.  The \n method  I  just  gave  you  is  only  an \n emergency.  I  just  procrastinated  for  the \n week  and  I  feel  like  I  can't  breathe \n type  of  emergency.  Now,  for  all  the \n urgent  but  due  this  week  tasks,  I  like \n to  do  the  following.  I  take  the  items \n from  my  mega  list  of  tasks  and  take \n three  for  each  day  of  the  week  depending \n again  on  urgency.  This  is  following  the \n rule  of  three.  Three  is  short  enough  for \n things  to  feel  achievable,  but  enough  to \n feel  like  you've  won  the  day.  I  go  on  my \n notes  app  and  pick  three  things  that \n feel  the  most  important  and  tick  them \n when  they're  done.  So  incredibly \n satisfying.  By  the  way,  self-discipline \n is  the  highest  form  of  selflove.  Love \n yourself  enough  to  get  your  task  of  the \n day  done.  And  if  you're  not  getting  them \n done,  then  you  need  to  reassess  the \n length  of  the  task.  So  let's  say  that \n you're  putting  create  content  for  social \n media  as  one  of  the  tasks.  But  the \n reality  is  that  it  actually  needs \n research,  ideation,  and  creation  time. \n Those  are  three  tasks  on  their  own,  not \n just  one.  Learn  how  to  break  the  tasks \n down  into  smaller  and  achievable  lists. \n You  need  to  failure  prove  yourself  in \n order  to  succeed  because  failing  to \n prepare  is  preparing  yourself  for \n failure.  Start  organizing  your  calendar \n for  a  brain  dump  day  where  you  dump \n everything  down  that  you  need  to  do  and \n dissect  exactly  what  you  need  to  do  and \n how  long  it's  going  to  take  you.  Every \n single  week,  take  your  Google  calendar \n and  block  an  hour  to  brain  dump  and  make \n your  calendar  work  for  you.  Let's  say \n every  Saturday  you'll  brain  dump \n everything  in  your  mind  and  you  then \n take  every  single  one  of  those  things \n and  assess  urgency,  priority,  and  time \n it  will  take  you  to  get  it  done.  Then \n automatically  schedule  those  into  your \n calendar.  I  have  a  deep  work  block  in \n the  morning,  but  then  I  put  the  micro \n tasks  I  need  to  do  in  that  time.  so  I \n don't  go  and  research  something  and \n completely  fall  off  track.  No,  no,  no. \n We're  not  going  to  do  that  this  year. \n We're  going  to  focus.  You  need  to  get \n your  entire  to-do  list  done  as  soon  as \n possible.  Then  you  can  dedicate  your \n time  to  create  space  for  the  things  you \n need  to  do  over  time  so  you  can  flow  and \n enjoy  your  work  instead  of  having  a \n rigid,  monotonous  routine  that  kills \n your  light.  Now,  let's  talk  about  the \n ultimate  focus  hack  to  tie  all  of  this \n together.  And  it's  not  an  overpriced \n coffee  supplement  or  a  fancy  neutropic. \n It's  actually  a  night  mental  closing \n shift  and  routine.  The  closing  shift  for \n me  is  basically  getting  ready  for  the \n day  before.  By  doing  that,  I  mentally \n clock  out  of  the  work  and  to-do  things \n that  I  had  done  all  day  and  write  down \n everything  that  is  pending  and  list  it \n for  the  next  day  so  I  can  work  where  I \n left  off  so  I  don't  scramble  around  the \n next  morning  trying  to  figure  out  where \n I  left  off.  Then  I  lay  out  the  clothes \n that  I  want  to  wear.  So  I  take  the \n decision  making  out  of  the  equation  in \n the  morning,  making  it  20  times  easier \n to  wake  up  and  leave  the  house  as  soon \n as  possible.  As  I  got  used  to  this \n morning  routine,  I  slowly  started  going \n to  bed  early  from  2:00  a.m.  to  then  1:00 \n a.m.  to  then  12:00  p.m.  to  now  10:00 \n p.m.  So  I  can  wake  up  at  5  or  6  and  feel \n rested.  I  shut  my  laptop.  I  meditate  for \n a  bit.  I  put  on  some  mouth  tape  and  I  go \n to  bed.  It's  simple,  but  it  will  change \n your  life  because  again,  productivity \n can't  be  fixed  with  one  magic  pill,  but \n it  can  be  fixed  by  a  solid  routine  that \n makes  you  want  to  fix  the  problem  at \n hands.  Intelligent  women  are  disciplined \n and  they  flow.  They  aren't  tied  down  to \n chaos  at  all  times.  They  fulfill  the \n promises  that  they  made  to  themselves. \n They  follow  their  plan  and  not  their \n mood.  And  through  that,  success, \n whatever  that  may  look  like,  follows. \n Now,  if  you  want  to  know  what  plan  I \n follow  to  change  my  life  and  mindset, \n then  watch  this  video  next.",
