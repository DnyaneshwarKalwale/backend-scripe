  "transcript": "[Music] \n [Applause] \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n I'm  going  to  talk  about  the  global \n energy  system  transformation  and  how \n technology,  innovation,  and  economics \n are  actually  driving  and  accelerating \n the  transformation. \n I'm  also  going  to  challenge  your \n thinking  a  little  bit  by  talking  about \n two  countries,  our  country,  Australia \n and  China.  And  the  two  are  very  very \n related  and  symbiotic  to  some  degree. \n And  we  need  to  understand  and  leverage \n that \n opportunity.  Now,  as  mentioned,  I  am \n also  going  to  have  to  acknowledge  I  am \n from  finance.  For  many,  many  years,  I \n was  head  of  research  at  the  biggest  bank \n in  the  world.  So,  apologies.  I'm  going \n to  talk  finance  language,  the  language \n of  numbers.  So  bear  with  me  on \n that.  That  there  are  a  whole  range  of \n crises  that  are  facing  us  and  our \n children  and  our  planet.  But  we're \n actually  trying  to  also  instill  hope. \n And  I  actually  am  enormously  hopeful. \n And  I've  been  doing  this  work  now  for  15 \n years.  And  I  am  phenomenally  hopeful \n because  I  spend  every  single  day \n studying  what  China  is  doing  and  I  was \n investing  in  China  15  years  ago  and  uh \n so  I  want  to  actually  break  that \n stereotype.  China  no  country  is  perfect \n but  China  is  absolutely  a  key  part  of \n our  of  the  solution  and  uh  Australia  is \n going  to  play  potentially  a  worldleading \n role. \n So  thank  you. \n I'm  going  to  talk  numbers,  of  course. \n Um,  so  to  me,  the  this  key  number,  $2.1 \n trillion,  that's  US  dollars,  real \n dollars  for \n [Music] \n now.  $2.1  trillion  was  how  much  the \n world  collectively  invested  in  clean \n tech  in  the  last  12  months.  It  is  a \n phenomenally  big  number.  It's  up  11%  in \n a  year.  It's  double  in  four \n years.  So,  we  are  winning.  We're  just \n not  winning  fast  enough.  It's  also \n double  the  amount  that  we  spent \n collectively  on  fossil  fuels  in  2024. \n So,  we  are  outspending  the  problem. \n Fossil  fuel  industry  is  the  threat  to \n our  planet.  It  is  the  central  threat  to \n our  planet.  But,  we \n are  winning.  We're  just  not  winning  fast \n enough.  if  we  need  to  double  or  triple \n the  amount  of  investment,  $6  trillion  a \n year.  But  I  come  from  finance.  That \n money  is  absolutely  there  if  we  have  the \n right  policy \n framework.  I'll  also \n emphasize  the  red  at  the  bottom. \n Appropriately,  China.  China  invested \n more  than  any  other  nation  in  clean  tech \n solutions  last  year.  They  spent  double \n the  entire  EU  investment.  They  spent \n double  what  America  invested  in  clean \n techch.  So  they  do  lead  the \n world.  I'll  also  emphasize  solar  is  an \n absolute  core  part  of  what  China  is \n investing  in  and  they've  been  doing  it \n in  partnership  with  Australia  for  the \n last  40  years.  University  of  New  South \n Wales  was  the  center  of  the  technology \n development  of  solar  40  years  ago  and \n today  it  still  is.  So  the  partnership \n between  our  two  countries  is  absolutely \n robust  and  we  need  to  make  it  a  lot  lot \n stronger.  But  solar  power  generation \n when  I  started  studying  it  was  a  cottage \n industry  15  years \n ago.  In  2012  since  2012  solar  power \n generation  globally  has  been  doubling \n every  3  years.  Now  again,  if  you  follow \n math,  doubling  when \n you're  1%  is  immaterial,  but  you  double \n and  double  and  double  again,  you  only \n need  to  do  it  six,  seven,  eight  times, \n and  solar  will  be  powering  the  world. \n Now,  we  all  know  that  the  sun \n predictably  goes  down  almost  every  day, \n every \n night.  Barnaby  Joyce  reminds  us  of  that \n all  the  time.  Solar  is  intermittent, \n like  as  though  we  don't  know. \n But  to  me,  the  most  powerful  thing \n that's  happening  in  2025  is  batteries. \n And  the  battery  technology  development \n that  China  is  leading  in  two  firms,  CL \n and  BYD,  is  beyond  belief.  It's  beyond \n anything  any  energy  analyst  forecasts. \n And  it  is  the  compounding  impact  of \n solar  and  batteries  to  time  shift  zero \n emissions,  cheap,  abundant  solar  power \n into  the  evening  peak  so  we  can  power \n our  economy  day  and  night.  And  it  is \n happening  at  enormous  speed  and \n scale.  So  China,  as  I  mentioned,  is  not \n perfect.  China  is  building  a  new  coal \n fired  power  plant  every  single  week.  The \n Muro  media  reminds  us  of  that.  I  get \n that  question  every  single  day  of  my \n career.  But  it  is  true,  but  it's  only  a \n part  of  the  truth.  China,  for  every  coal \n plant  bu  that  they  build,  builds  six \n wind  and  solar \n projects  every  single \n week.  China  in  one  year  last  year  built \n 370  gawatt  of  wind  and  solar  in  one \n year,  more  than  the  rest  of  the  world \n combined.  more  than  any  nation's  ever \n built  before  in  history.  China  has  set \n that  record  every  year  for  a  decade  and \n they  keep  beating  the  record \n dramatically.  So  you  often  hear  the \n point,  I  often  hear  the  point,  it \n doesn't  matter  what  Australia  does, \n China's  the  problem.  Australia  is  only \n 1%  of  world \n emissions  domestically.  1%  doesn't \n matter  what  we  do.  We've  had  plenty  of \n our  politicians  tell  us  that,  but  it's  a \n falsehood.  When  you  include  our  exports, \n Australia  represents  5%  of  the  world's \n total  emissions.  It  absolutely  matters \n to  the  world  what  we  do  and  it  matters \n to  our  children  and  our  economy  what  we \n do.  We  are  actually  a  fossil  fuel  pro \n state. \n We  are  the  third  largest  or  the  top \n three  fossil  fuel  export  nation  in  the \n world  alongside  Russia  and  Saudi  Arabia. \n We're  a  pro  state.  We  are  the  third \n largest  exporter  of  fossil  fuels  in  the \n world.  So  when  we're  busy  throwing  rocks \n at  China,  we  should  understand  what  we \n are.  So  going  back  to  China's \n leadership,  China  is  the  world's  biggest \n investor  in  research  and  development  in \n all  of  the  technologies  we  need,  all  of \n the  zero  emissions  technologies  we  need. \n They're  the  biggest  manufacturer  of  all \n of  the  clean  technologies  that  we  need \n in  the  world  by  a  mile.  They're  the \n biggest  installer  of  those  clean  tech \n solutions  in  the  world  by  a  mile. \n Twothirds  of  all  wind  farms  built  in  the \n world  last  year  were  installed  in \n China.  They're  also  the  world's  number \n one  exporter  of  all  of  those  clean  tech \n solutions  that  we  need.  And  increasingly \n they're  the  world's  largest  provider  of \n capital  globally  in  clean  tech  solutions \n and  the  majority  of  that  capital  is  to \n going  to  the  global  south  in  alignment \n with  China's  Paris  commitment. \n So,  China  is  actually  driving  a \n transformation.  Now,  I  did  warn  you \n numbers.  The  last  3  months  does  not  make \n a \n trend.  But  in  the  first  quarter  of  2025, \n China's  coal  consumption  and  China's \n half  the  world's  coal  production \n consumption.  They're  the  number  one \n importer  of  coal  in  the  world.  So,  what \n happens  in  China  drives  the  world's \n emissions.  And  China's  coal  consumption \n in  its  power  sector  dropped  by  an \n unprecedented \n 4.1%.  That's  in  an  electricity  sector \n that  grew  by  3.4%  yearonear.  That's  in \n an  economy  that  grew,  despite  what  the \n Murdoch  media  tells  you,  by  5.4% \n yearonear.  Economic  growth  Australia \n would  kill  for.  China  delivered  it,  yet \n coal  power  went  down  by  4.1%. \n But  the  key  number  on  that  is  that \n renewable  energy  generation  grew \n 26.7%  yearonear  and  it  is  now  big  enough \n to  provide  all  of  the  incremental  demand \n energy  demand  that  China  needs  and \n actually  starting  to  eat  into  coal.  So \n you  have  a  situation  where  China  could \n possibly  have  peaked  emissions  either \n last  year  or  this  year.  And  I'm  not \n saying  declining,  I'm  talking  about \n peaking,  but  plateauing  for  the  next \n five  or  6  years.  That  is  6  years  ahead \n of  China's  Paris  agreement \n [Applause] \n [Music] \n commitments.  It  is  staggering  to  think \n of  that  Chinese  leadership  and  uh  that \n we  need  to  see  it  replicated.  We  need  to \n see  extended.  The  response  from  the \n Chinese  leader  at  the  UN  two  weeks  ago \n was  that  China  was  going  to  collaborate \n and  cooperate  with  the  world.  No matter \n what  happens  in  other  nations,  China  was \n going  to  collaborate  and  go  global  and \n help  the  global  south.  Now,  I  don't  want \n to  make  China  out  to  be  a  saint.  No \n country  is  perfect.  Our  country  is  far \n from  perfect,  but  they  are  moving \n dramatically.  China  is  also  our  number \n one  trade  partner. \n by  a  mile.  30%  of  our  exports  go  to \n China.  Now,  this  chart  from  Bloomberg \n New  Energy  Finance  highlights  that  China \n has  invested  more  in  clean  tech  than  any \n other  clean  techch  manufacturing  than \n any  other  nation  in  the  world  for  the \n last  6  years  in  a  row.  But  it's  not  a \n little  bit.  It's  80%  of  the  world's \n investment.  It  is  absolutely  staggering \n to  see  the  scale.  And  it's  actually \n impossible  to  understand  unless  you  go \n there  and  see  it  for \n yourself.  The  factories  are  enormous. \n The  robotics  are \n unbelievable  and  the  scale  is  there.  And \n China  is  going  to  continue  investing. \n And  so  that  is  partly  what  Trump  is \n responding  to.  But  the  only  way  you \n respond  is  by  throwing  down  the  gauntlet \n and  challenging  them.  And  that's  what \n the  inflation  reduction  act  was  about. \n Trump's  thrown  that  out  of  the  window. \n He's  walked  off  the  playing  field  and \n left  it  to \n China.  Now,  that  is  a  serious \n geopolitical  threat.  You  can't  have  one \n nation  dominate  the  world's  supply \n chains  in  almost  all  of  these  zero \n emissions  industries  of  the  future.  That \n is  a  problem,  but  is  also  a  problem  that \n Australia  is  not  going  to  individually \n solve.  We're  a  relatively  small  economy. \n We  need  to  work  with  our  key  allies  and \n help  deliver  where  we  can,  which  is  to \n drive \n decarbonization.  Australia  does  have \n serious  momentum  and  the  re-election  of \n the  Albanese  government  does  actually \n give  me  a  lot  of  confidence.  The  future \n made  in  Australia  is  a  strategy  designed \n to  re-engage  to  pivot  Australian \n manufacturing.  It's  really  hard  when  we \n don't  have  a  price  on  carbon  for  finance \n to  lead.  and  I  am  from  finance  and \n that's  why  I  spend  all  of  my  time  now \n advising  the  government  and  advocating \n to  the  government  what  we  need  to  do.  We \n have  made  serious  progress.  So  again, \n the  Murdoch  media  tells  you  we  can't \n deliver  on  Minister  Bowen's  82% \n renewables  by  2030.  That's  rubbish.  In \n the  fourth  quarter  of  last  year,  we \n averaged  46%  renewable  energy  on  average \n across  the  national  electricity  market. \n 40.1%  in  the  last  12  months.  We  can \n easily  do  it,  but  we've  got  to  go \n faster.  And  that's  where  the  government \n providing  the  leadership  and  the  policy \n is  going  to  drive  finance  and  solutions. \n So,  I'm  going  to  finish  by  talking  about \n steel.  That  might  sound  a  bit  of  a  leap, \n but  there  is  a  connection.  China  is  the \n largest  steel  producer  in  the  world.  50% \n of  the  world's  steel  production,  but \n Australia  supplies  50%  of  the  raw \n materials  to  the  world's  steel  industry. \n 50%  of  the  iron  ore,  50%  of  the  coing \n coal.  So  Australia  can  play  an \n absolutely  key  role  in  pivoting  our \n mining  industry  from  exporting \n unprocessed  iron  ore,  leveraging  our \n renewable  energy.  Brilliant  potential \n and  embodying  that  in  refined  iron \n exporting  green  iron  to  China.  It  is  a \n billion  ton  peranom  opportunity  for \n Australia.  It  is  a  massive  hundred \n billion  dollar  uplift  in  our \n exports  annually  if  we  get  it  right.  If \n we  partner  with  China,  if  we  collaborate \n with  China,  Japan,  India,  South  Korea, \n but  number  one,  China,  because  86%  of \n our  iron  ore  goes  to  China.  And  so  if \n Australia  pivots  from  a  fossil  fuel \n nation,  we  can  become  a  world  leader  and \n contribute  a  billion  ton  peranom \n reduction  in  global  emissions  and  be  an \n absolute  world  leader  and  actually \n provide  our  children  with  a  sustainable \n planet  and  a  sustainable  economy.  Thank \n you. \n [Applause] \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n [Music]",
