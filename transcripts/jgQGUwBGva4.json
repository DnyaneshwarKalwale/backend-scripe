it  is  most  likely \n headquartered  where  I  would  have  gotten \n that  Jesus \n Christ  is  this  some  car  cuz  like  I  don't \n it's  some  business  some  business \n miles  wait \n what

us \n Marquez  this  review  was  left  by  Amazon \n user  Ivan  sorrano  okay  the  review  is \n titled \n satisfa  the  review  reads  mui  contento \n four  stars  what  phone  is  this  a

again  bro  that  is  the  worst \n category  and \n I  you  got  this  miles  come  on  Miles  you \n can  do  it  the  answer  is  just  either \n iPhone  16  or  iPhone  16  there's  this \n review  is  one  star  it  is  left  by  Amazon \n user  Ross  s  the  review  is  titled  no  SIM \n card  the  review  reads  looks  like  a  phone \n but  doesn't  have  a  SIM  card  okay  well \n that  nrows  it  down  and  the  answer  is \n only  a \n smartphone  shut  up  it  came  out  in  the \n last  12  months  is \n that  I  don't  I  don't  think  that's \n actually  true  about  this  one  uh  no  SIM \n card  looks  a  pH  but  is  not  a  phone  but \n doesn't  have  a  SIM  card  oh  we  reviewed \n this  wait  no  I \n know  you  should  know  this  you  have  to \n know  this  you

little  bite \n brownie  wow  all  right  before  we  continue \n on  to  our  next  throw  I  think  we  should \n take  some  time  to  meet  our  contestants \n Mariah  is  it  true  that  before  working \n for  Marquez  brownley  you  were  actually \n the  owner  operator  and  Driver  of  the \n Oscar  Meyer  Wier  mobile  that  was \n actually  my  side  hustle  um  and  I'd  go \n around  the  country  and  that's  how  I'm  so \n knowledgeable  and \n worldly  period  I'm  hoping  to  get  the \n science  and  animal  situation  um  I  don't \n trust  any  of  the  other \n categories  think  yep  Maria  this  is  a \n onear  review  from  user  kuya  penoy  the \n review  is  titled  my  experience  was \n terrible  the  review  reads  my  experience \n was  terrible  one  star  color  obsidian \n size  256  gab  see  this  is  going  to  show \n how  little  I  know  about  phones  I  feel \n like  there  is  an  obsidian  iPhone  but \n miles  makes  it  seem  like  there's  not \n based  on  miles's  face  it's  maybe  Apple \n or \n Samsung  but  pixel  no  pixel  can  you  be  a \n little  more  specific  the  what  are  we \n pixel  9  can  you  be  a  little  more \n specific  than \n that  there's  one  more  level  specificity \n looking  for  I'm  sorry  I  cannot  give  you \n this  point  the  correct  answer  was  the \n Google  pixel  9  Pro \n fold  the  pro  it  was  close  it  was  close \n it  was \n close  miles  what  has  been  alive  on  Earth \n for  longer  shark \n or \n trees  I'm  going  to  go  uh  sharks  sharks \n is  in  fact  correct  I  have  no  other \n context  to  provide  for  that  fact  oh \n really  do  you  guys  hear  that  do  you  guys \n hear  that  alarm  playing  in  the  distance \n you  guys  hear  that  siren  that  I'm  going \n to  add  in  post  that  is  not  actually \n playing  in  the  room  with  us  right  now \n that  means  now  from  this  point  going \n forward  if  our  main  contestant  does  not \n know  know  the  answer  to  a  question \n someone  from  the  peanut  gallery  May \n steal  the  question  from  them  but  there \n is  an  asterisk  before  your  steal  you \n either  must  ask  the  audience  to  like  And \n subscribe  or  give  me  your  host  Ellis \n Roven  a \n compliment \n terrible  you're  making  him  nervous \n stop  Green  Oh  but  you  already  have  Ain \n question  and  that  was  your  third  Dart  so \n unfortunately  I'm  going  to  need  you  to \n get  back  in  the  line  Fs  in  the \n chat  Mariah  flamingos  emperor  penguins \n and  pigeons  despite  hatching  their  young \n from  eggs  all  produce  their  own  bizarre \n version  of \n what  this  is  this  seems  like  a  hard  one \n but  David  looks  like  he  knows  something \n David  take  it  away  D  would  you  like  to \n steal  you  do  have  a  point  to  lose  and \n nothing  to  gain  but  all  right  before  we \n go  to  this  question  like  subscribe  leave \n a  comment  low  effort  wish  I  got  a \n compliment  I'll  let  you  answer  oh  wait \n wait  I'll  give  you  a  compliment  Ellis  I \n love  the  tie  thank  you  that  was

stomach  or  an  extra  part  of  their \n digestive  system  that  produces  a  high \n fat  high  protein  crop  liquid  crop  crop \n liquid  dude  no  way  no  uh  we  actually \n have  a  case

Motorola  I  don't  know  any  motor  just \n Motorola  motola  there's  only  one  right \n that  is  incorrect  would  anyone  like  to \n steal  wait  if  I  don't  have  any  points  I \n have  nothing  to  lose  right  you  have \n literally  nothing  to  lose  you  can  just \n say  a  phone  with  no  Stakes  I  feel  like \n it  could  be  another  folding  phone  but \n we've  already  talked  about  a  folding \n not  a  folding  pH  not  a  folding  phone  you \n should  give  a  have  no  points  is  it  I \n feel  like  I  want  to  say  like  it's  a \n crazy  Chinese  phone  situation  it  is  a \n crazy  phone  the  company  that  makes  this \n phone  is  actually \n headquartered  in  London  you  should  guess \n 12  yeah  it's  the  nothing  phone  2  or  2A \n 2A  is  correct  congratulations  on  your \n first  point  I  did  have  to  spoon  feed  it \n to  you  but  I'll  take  it  I'll  take  it  as \n you  should  I'm  behind  the  line  making \n sure  behind  the  L  um  I'm  going  to  try \n and  go  for  yellow  this  time  oh  yes  get \n wrong  for  nbhd  more  question  always \n notable  MKBHD  videos  such  as  Tesla  solar \n roof  I'm  taking  a  break  and  on  quitting \n YouTube  were  not  filmed  here  at  the \n studio  with  the  exception  of  one  shot \n from  Tesla  solar  roof  where  were  those \n videos  filmed  oh  bro  sorry  no  it's  dude \n it's  his  house  it  is  his  house  and  most \n specifically  his  basement  well  I  just \n want  yellow  yellow  yellow  nope  pink \n don't  need  that  yellow  unequivocally  and \n without  a  doubt  also  objectively  and \n datadriven  purely  what  is  the  coolest \n device  we  have  ever  gotten  at  the \n studio  how  how  are  you  quantifying  cool \n the  coolest  what  is  the  coolest  and \n dopest  and  most  awesome  device  anyone \n has  ever  sent  us  to  review  according  to \n it's  not  according  to  anyone  it's \n objective  fact \n oh  God  but  you  wrote  the  question  maybe \n I  did  maybe  Eric  wrote  it  maybe  Rich \n wrote  it  Harper  was  there  this  doesn't \n feel  like  the  same  category  as  before \n three  two  the  3D  printer  unfortunately \n the  3D  printer  is  incorrect  the  answer  I \n was  looking  for  was  Mariah  let's  say  it \n together  purple  iPhone \n Mini  you  guys  don't  even  listen  to  me \n it's  the  Honda  Moto  compacto  okay  your \n other  love  my  other  love  and \n unequivocally  better  than  any  piece  of \n TCH  this \n feels  like  a  deviation  I'm  kind  of \n shocked  you  didn't  purple  iPhone \n Mini  I'm  just  hop  to  hit  the \n board  David  you  have  in  fact  hit  the \n board  but  you  did  hit  blue  which  you've \n already  gotten  not \n ideal \n nice  and  think  of  every  phone  you've \n ever  thought  of  in  your  entire \n life  we're  think  have  them  this  review \n comes  from  Best  Buy  the  review  reads  as \n usual  a  lot  of  hype  over  improvements \n that  are  barely  perceptible  I  upgraded \n from  the  14  and  expected  substantial \n Improvement  but  no  this  feels  like  a \n boomer  review  like  a  boomer  saying  this \n Des  by.com  yeah  no  one's  a  time  thing  to \n steal  I'm  I'm  going  to  say  I'm  wa  wait \n wa  wait  I'm  I'm  going  to  say  I'm  going \n to  say \n iPhone \n 15  I'm  sorry  that  did  not  come  out  in \n the  last  12  months  we  are  on  the  iPhone \n 16  Mariah  still  hold  up  the  back  of  the \n train  with  two  points  but  you're  only \n one  point  away  from  tying  David  will  you \n do  it  yes  no  it's  slid  down  orange  which \n one  of  these  is  not  a  feature  on  the  Lee \n Auto  Mega  m  a  a  builtin  refrigerator  mhm \n B  incar  AI  filters  for \n selfies  c  a  spare  tire  or  d  a  zero  to  60 \n time  of  5  and  1/2  seconds  I  did  ride  in \n this  car  so  it'  be  cringe  if  I  didn't \n know  I  do  remember  the  refrigerator  I \n feel  like  the  AI  filters  kind  of  would \n make  sense  cuz  there  is  like  a  camera \n for  like  the  display  they  thought  of \n everything  so  I  feel  like  they  would \n give  you  the  spare  tire  probably  miles \n how  miles  what  do  you  like  do  you  like \n the  Le  Auto  it's  one  of  the  greatest \n cars  i'  ever  made  yeah  how  is  it  I  mean \n they  they  gave  you  I  feel  like  that  car \n gives  you  everything  you  you  want  like \n everything  you  yeah  but  do  you  want  a \n spare  tire \n I  think  everyone  wants  a  spare  tire  and \n does  everyone  get  a  spare  tire  I'm  going \n to  maybe  say  spare  tire  then  they  do  not \n give  you  a  spare  tire  yeah  that  is \n correct  there  is  no  spare  tire  in  the \n Lee  automega  they  give  you  literally \n everything  else  but  not  that \n yellow \n yellow  L \n Marquez  you  have  had  quite  the \n illustrious  career  on  YouTube  I  think \n it's  safe  to  say  that  at  this  point  you \n are  one  of  the  ogs  one  of  the  grandpas \n of  YouTube  you've  been  in  the  game \n Marquez  what  was  the  last  video  on  the \n main  channel  to  not  hit  1  million \n [Music] \n views  I  really  like \n you  that  doesn't  count  nothing  specific \n but  that  doesn't  count  I  like  you  I  like \n you  you're  one  of  my  best  friends  say \n more  say  no  say  more  give  a  real \n compliment  all  right  Marquez  I'm  going \n to  need  an  answer  in \n three  two  a  Q&A  that  is  incorrect  A  Q&A \n would  go  off  yeah  that's  a  banger  video \n miles  what  was  the  last  video  to  not \n reach  1  million  views  on  the  main \n channel  uh  was  it
