  "transcript": "Nine  years  ago,  I  stumbled  across  this \n blog  post  written  by  this  genius  named \n Tim  Urban.  Tim's  post  changed  my  life \n because  in  this  post,  Tim  talked  about \n time,  but  not  time  in  the  way  we \n traditionally  talk  about  it.  I'm  not \n talking  about  time  management  like \n blocking  your  calendar  to  write  that \n term  paper  or  figuring  out  when  to \n study.  Tim  was  talking  about  our \n personal  time,  how  that  time  is  finite \n and  you  just  cannot  afford  to  waste \n it.  See,  my  job  tonight  is  to  bring \n awareness.  What  you  do  with  that \n awareness  is  entirely  up  to  you.  But  I \n can  promise  you  this.  You  cannot  unsee \n and  you  cannot  unhear  what  I'm  about  to \n share.  So,  you're  going  to  hear  me  ask  a \n few  times  tonight  this  one  question. \n What  are  you  going  to  do  about \n it?  James  Clear,  author  of  the \n best-selling  book  Atomic  Habits,  once \n said,  \"Whatever  your  a  whatever  age  you \n are  today,  your  future  self  would  love \n to  be  it.\"  Most  people  do  not  consider \n 65  to  be  a  young  age,  but  when  you're \n 75,  you'd  love  to  rewind  to  65  and \n regain  those  years. \n Few  people  would  describe  35  as  your \n youth,  but  in  your  mid-50s,  your  mid30s \n will  seem  like  the  young  you.  Today  is  a \n great  opportunity  no  matter  your \n age.  That's  probably  a  quote  we  should \n all  reread  a  few  times \n over  because  the  reality  is  everybody  in \n this  room,  we  are  the  youngest  we  will \n ever  be  right  now.  And  I  emphasize  that \n point  because  oftentimes  I  look  out  into \n the  audience  and  I  see  the  faces  and  I \n know  what  some  people  are  thinking. \n Gosh,  I  wish  I  could  go  back  and  do  that \n over  again.  I  wish  I  would  have  pursued \n that  dream  job  or  pursued  that \n opportunity.  And  to  that  I  say  no,  no, \n no,  no,  no,  no.  You  are  the  youngest  you \n will  ever  be  right \n now.  So  what  are  you  going  to  do  about \n it?  Let's  take  a  little  bit  deeper  dive \n into  this  idea  that  time  is  finite. \n Here's  some  visual  representations  of \n time.  Here's  90 \n years.  Here's  90  years  in \n months.  Here's  90  years  in \n Fridays.  Now,  here's  90  years  in \n winters.  I  just  grade  out  46  of  those \n winters.  I'm  46  years  old.  I've  had  46 \n winters. \n Now,  I  live  here  in \n Phoenix.  So,  every  winter  if  we  want \n snow,  we've  got  to  drive,  my  family  and \n I,  we  drive  seven  hours  north  to \n Colorado  for  that  for  that  snow.  And \n when  we  hit  the  snow,  I  get  five  days  of \n snowboarding \n in.  So,  I  know  I  have  90  winters  up \n here,  but  we're  going  to  work  with  80 \n instead  because  Gubber,  we  kind  of  live \n to  80. \n Okay,  so  let's  work  through  some  of  this \n math.  I'm  46,  means  I  have  34  winters \n remaining.  I  get  five  days  of \n snowboarding  in  each  year.  So  that  means \n I  have  170  more  days  on  the \n snowboard.  But  here's  the \n kicker.  That's  kind  of  a \n lie  because  the  the  truth  is  I'm  not \n going  to  be  snowboarding  at  75  the  way  I \n do  right  now.  Don't  get  me  wrong,  I'm \n going  to  be  hard  at  75.  I'll  give  it \n everything  I \n got,  but  it's  not  going  to  be  like  it  is \n right  now  when  I'm  charging  down  the \n hill  with  the  kids  by  my \n side.  See,  the  way  I  figure  out  this,  I \n figured  this  math,  I  have  maybe  10  more \n solid  years  on  the  snowboard  going  at \n the  rate  I  go \n today.  So,  the  truth  is  I  have  about  50 \n more  days  on  the  snowboard.  So,  knowing \n that  that  now  has  an  expiration  date, \n how  might  I  treat  the  next  day  that  I'm \n on  the  mountain? \n Am  I  going  to  go  down  the  hill  a  time  or \n two,  then  head  to  the  bar,  hang  out  like \n so  many  others?  Or  am  I  going  to  go  as \n hard  as  I  possibly  can,  charge  down  that \n hill,  get  as  much  out  of  that  day  as \n possible?  See  what  in  your  world \n actually  has  an  expiration  date?  We  have \n a  a  lot  of  college  students  here \n tonight.  How  about  road  trips? \n How  many  more  road  trips  do  you  have \n with  your  best  friends?  The  interesting \n thing  about  road  trips,  you  may  already \n have  your  last  one  before  you  even \n realized  it  was  going  to  be  the  last \n one.  How  many  more  late  night \n conversations  do  you  get  to  have  with \n your  best  friends  studying  in  your  dorm \n or  at  the  coffee  shop?  How  many  more \n loose  threat  threads  do  you  have  to  tie \n out  before  you  graduate  and  you  all  go \n your  separate  ways? \n Now,  as  thoughtprovoking  as  that  one  is, \n let's  talk  about  our  loved  ones.  See, \n here's  my  girls,  my  daughters.  That's \n Avery  and  Katie.  They're  14  and \n 12.  Did  you  know  that  the  average  kid \n spends  300  days  per  year  with  their \n parent  from  the  age  of  0  to  18? \n And  then  after  18,  they  spend  either  10 \n or  30  days  with  their  parent.  30  if  they \n live  within  proximity,  if  they  live  in \n the  same  town,  10  if  they  live  further \n away.  Now  Avery's  14,  as  I  mentioned, \n I'm  46.  So  when  you  run  out  this  math, \n Avery  and  I  have  already  spent  4,200 \n days \n together.  Now  she  has  four  more  years \n before  she  turns  18.  So  that's  another \n 1,200 \n days.  And  then  when  she's  18,  I'll  be \n 50.  I  already  mentioned  we  kind  of  go  to \n 80.  So  that's  30  more  years,  900  more \n days  because  she's  required  to  live \n close  by.  It's  a  family \n rule.  So  what  does  that  tell  us? \n Avery  and  I  have  already  spent \n 67%  of  our  total  time  together  if  we  do \n nothing  different  to  change  the \n time.  Katie,  my  12-year-old,  we're  58 \n 59%  of  the  of  the  time  already \n covered.  Now,  let's  flip  this  a \n bit.  That's  my \n dad.  He's \n 72.  I'm  not  going  to  run  out  this  math \n for  you,  but  no.  Barring  I  do  nothing \n different,  we  are \n 96%  of  the  way \n through.  How  about \n you?  Again,  I  know  we  have  a  younger \n crowd.  A  lot  of  you  think,  well,  I  have \n time.  Maybe,  by  the  way,  this  is  me \n graduating  just  a  few  years  ago. \n Let's  say  you're  20  and  your  mom's  50 \n and  she  has  30  more  years  just  like \n me.  If  you  live  by,  you  have  90  9  I'm \n sorry,  900  more  days.  If  you  live  a \n further  a  little  bit  further  apart,  you \n have  300  more  days.  No  matter  how  you \n spin  this  one,  you're  actually \n 90%  of  the  way  through.  again  barring \n you  don't  do  something  about \n it  because  you  have  some  serious  choices \n to  make  here.  See,  you  can  either  look \n at  that  math  and  feel  bad  and  have  some \n regret,  wish  you  could  go  back  in  time, \n or  you  can  do  something  about \n it. \n See,  I  don't  really  love  baseball  games. \n They're  boring. \n But  guess  who  loves  baseball \n games?  My  dad  does.  So  I  have  season \n tickets  to  the  Arizona \n Diamondbacks.  And  I  really,  really, \n really  don't  like \n golf.  Four  or  five  hours  on  a  golf \n course.  I  mean,  come  on.  But  guess  who \n loves  golf?  My  dad  does.  So  I  take \n lessons  and  try  to  get  out  on  the  course \n as  often  as  I  can. \n And  this  last  picture  here,  the  woman \n opposite  side  of  the  picture  from  me, \n that's  my \n mom.  See,  I  hired  my  mom  to  my  company  a \n handful  of  years \n ago.  And  I  did  not  hire  her  for  her \n talent.  Though,  to  be  super  clear,  and \n it's  important  I  say  this,  otherwise \n she'll  strangle  me.  She's  incredibly \n talented.  I  hired  my  mom  so  I  can  create \n more  time  with  her. \n my  math.  I  think  when  all  said  and  done, \n we  created  an  additional  4,000  days \n together.  So,  what  are  you  going  to  do \n about \n it?  See,  I  think  there's  some  action \n steps  that  everybody  in  this  room  can \n take  starting  right \n now.  This  first  one,  write  your  own \n eulogy.  This  may  sound  a  little  morbid, \n but  I  promise  you  it  is  not. \n I  want  you  to  picture  your  celebration \n of \n life.  Specifically,  I  want  you  to  think \n about  who's  sitting  in  those  first  three \n rows.  What  are  they  saying  about  you? \n What  stories  are  they  telling?  What \n stories  would  you  like  them  to  be \n telling?  When  someone  stands  up  to  talk \n about  you  and  the  impact  that  you  made \n on  the  world  and  on  your  peers  and  on \n your  family,  what  would  you  like  them  to \n say?  Now,  compare  that  against  your \n present  reality.  Awesome.  Now  you  get  to \n write  a  plan  to  take  your  your  current \n reality  to  your  envisioned \n future.  Next  thing  I  think  you  could  do, \n take  no  days  off.  That  doesn't  mean  work \n every  day  or  think  about  this  subject \n non-stop.  What  it  means  is  that  every \n single  day  presents  a  new  opportunity \n for  every  one  of  us  to  get  a  little  bit \n better  at  something.  Maybe  that's  five \n more  pages  to  read  to  make  you  a  bit \n smarter.  Maybe  it's  one  more  experience. \n Maybe  it's  a  half  hour  longer \n conversation  with  someone  important  to \n you.  Take  no  days \n off.  And  then  lastly,  I  want  to \n challenge  everybody  here  to  get  weird. \n That's  kind  of  a  funny  one,  but  here's \n the  deal.  When  you  study  success, \n success  in  business,  success  in  life, \n success  in  relationships,  what  you  find \n is  those  that  are  successful  are  doing \n things  differently  than  everybody  else \n around  them.  They're  doing  things  than \n the  status  quo.  And  by  definition,  guess \n what?  That's  called  weird.  To  which  I \n say,  \"Yeah,  let's  get  weird.\"  How  are \n you  approaching  your  time?  How  are  you \n approaching  your  life?  How  do  you \n approach  your  relationships?  I  sure  as \n heck  don't  want  to  do  it  like  the  status \n quo.  Do \n you?  There's  a  great  book  called  The  Top \n Five  Regrets  of  the  Dying.  It  was \n written  by  this  nurse  named  Bronnie  Wear \n who  had  an  opportunity  to  work  with \n people \n towards  the  very  towards  their  very  last \n days,  the  last  days  of  their  lives.  And \n she  got  to  talk  to  them  about  their \n regrets.  You  know,  the  number  one  regret \n that  she \n found,  I  wish  I  would  have  led  a  life \n true  to \n myself.  See,  I \n refuse  to  have  that  regret,  and  I \n challenge  everyone  here  to  do  the  same. \n Now  go  call  your  mom.  Thank  you.",
