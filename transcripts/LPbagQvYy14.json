  "transcript": "overweight  so  you  can  rest  session  can \n see  you  soon \n unhappy  unemployed  hey  guys  I'm  about  to \n go  meet  some  of  my  friends  and  diagnosed \n with  every  single  mental  illness  this  is \n what  my  life  looked  like  for  years  ago \n fast  forward  to  today  and  my  life  looks \n completely  different  I  built  two \n successful  businesses  I  spoken  on  stages \n all  over  the  world  and  I'm  in  the  best \n shape  ever  both  physically  and  mentally \n I'm  living  the  life  I  once  paid  for  but \n it's  didn't  happen  overnight  and  it \n wasn't  easy  I  had  to  literally  brainwash \n myself  in  five  different  stages  in  order \n to  get  here  so  if  you're  feeling  like  me \n 4  years  ago  lost  tired  misunderstood \n knowing  that  you  could  be  achieving  more \n then  this  video  is  for  you  now  stage \n number  one  the  anti  Vision  so  like \n anyone  my  age  the  first  place  I  looked \n for  when  I  realized  I  had  a  problem  was \n the  internet  and  at  a  time  one  of  the \n big  trends  for  self-help  was \n affirmations  but  I  had  way  too  much \n negative  energy  and  anger  to  pretend \n that  I  was  happy  and  living  my  dream \n reality  so  I  did  some  something \n different  I  looked  at  the  facts  I  listed \n them  all  down  and  instead  of  using  those \n things  as  excuses  I  made  it  my  life's \n mission  to  never  let  any  of  that  ever \n happened  to  me  again  and  this  is  called \n negative  visualization  and  it's \n incredibly  powerful  most  people  need \n someone  to  run  towards  I  just  needed \n something  to  run  against  so  when  I \n couldn't  get  out  of  bed  or  I  put  off \n finding  a  job  fixing  my  health  or \n learning  new  skills  I  reminded  myself  of \n where  I'd  end  up  if  I  kept  on  giving \n myself  excuses  and  the  thing  that  pissed \n me  off  the  most  was  the  consistent \n support  for  being  being  average  that \n Society  gave  us  love  yourself  as  you  are \n or  like  you  don't  need  to  change  yes  I \n did  because  it's  not  okay  to  be  unhappy \n every  day  it's  not  okay  to  take  pills \n every  day  it's  not  okay  to  be  addicted \n to  social  media  and  it's  not  okay  to  be \n unemployed  so  this  negative \n visualization  can  help  you  build  what  is \n known  as  that  anti  vision  and  my  formula \n was  simple  look  at  the  goals  and  dreams \n I  had  see  how  far  away  I  was  from \n achieving  them  look  at  the  resume  of \n failures  I  had  get  angry  and  then  use \n that  pain  as  power  so  at  the  very  bare \n minute  minimum  I'd  get  out  of  bed \n because  honestly  that  is  the  hardest  bed \n going  from  zero  to  one  and  after  a  week \n of  Simply  getting  out  of  bed  and  going \n for  a  walk  I  stacked  one  big  win  which \n led  me  to  the  second  phase  of  hacking  my \n brain  phase  two  addiction  look  feeling \n sad  and  staying  in  bed  is  easy  but \n getting  out  of  bed  and  doing  something \n completely  new  is  hard  this  is  because \n our  brains  are  wired  to  seek  comfort  and \n avoid  pain  but  when  you  do  something \n hard  and  reward  yourself  afterwards  you \n rewire  your  brain  for  growth  you  create \n a  POS  positive  feedback  loop  in  your \n brain  reinforcing  that  pushing  through \n discomfort  leads  to  positive  outcomes \n essentially  you're  learning  how  to  delay \n gratification  and  learning  this  will \n make  your  future  self  thank  you  here's \n how  it  all  started  for  me  instead  of \n Doom  scrolling  on  social  media  yet  again \n I  decided  to  sign  up  to  a  997  course  on \n social  media  the  course  was  horrible  and \n it  didn't  make  me  any  richer  or  smarter \n but  it  gave  me  access  to  the  people  in \n the  same  boat  as  me  and  every  single \n person  that  is  looking  to  succeed  or \n change  needs  this  you  need  to  be \n surrounded  by  people  who  Elevate  you \n even  if  it's  just  a  tiny  little  bit  and \n in  that  group  from  thatal  I  saw  all \n members  keeping  each  other  accountable \n and  pushing  each  other  more  knowledge \n new  goals  and  different  conversations \n and  slowly  I  became  addicted  to  the \n dopamine  Rush  from  sharing  progress  on \n that  Facebook  group  with  other  people  I \n could  only  post  a  win  until  it  was  a  win \n which  meant  that  I  had  to  sit  down  and \n actually  do  the  work  for  hours  days  or \n even  weeks  forcing  me  to  delay \n gratification  daily  which  in  turn  led  me \n to  take  Massive  Action  so  I  could \n attempt  to  get  to  those  wins  quicker  and \n this  cycle  would  repeat  itself  every \n time  I  joined  a  new  course  or  group  even \n if  I  didn't  end  up  succeeding  at  the \n business  model  I  was  slowly  stack  in \n private  victories  the  dopamine  I  used  to \n get  from  social  media  sleeping  or \n overeating  was  slowly  being  replaced  by \n this  new  dopamine  of  completing  a  hard \n task  and  posting  it  in  that  group  I \n brainwashed  myself  to  be  addicted  to \n hard  things  and  here's  the  thing  the \n more  impatient  you  become  with  executing \n on  the  inputs  the  better  your  outputs \n will  become  and  in  order  to  do  that  you \n need  two  things  have  a  reward  system  for \n yourself  so  if  you  wake  up  and  go  for  a \n walk  you  can  have  20  minutes  of \n guilt-free  social  media  scrolling  if  you \n go  to  the  gym  five  times  this  week  you \n can  then  buy  a  new  hoodie  or  if  you  make \n five  call  calls  today  then  you  can  post \n it  on  the  Facebook  group  you're  in  and \n get  some  higher  quality  dopamine  from \n the  praise  you'll  receive  and  again  it's \n all  about  rewiring  your  brain  to  Crave \n the  hard  by  using  positive  reinforcement \n where  your  hard  work  fuels  your  success \n and  that  success  motivates  you  to  push \n even  harder  second  you  need \n accountability  bodies  the  biggest \n blessing  from  social  media  is  how  easy \n it  is  to  find  people  who  who  are  just \n like  you  invest  in  a  course  and  join \n this  communities  I  guarantee  you'll  find \n like-minded  people  who  are  trying  to \n level  up  as  well  find  one  person  trying \n to  achieve  a  similar  goal  and  challenge \n each  other  until  you  no  longer  need  the \n external  person  there  this  is  still  my \n biggest  hack  when  it  comes  to  growth  I'm \n extremely  competitive  and  I  love  a \n challenge  the  pursuit  of  growth  may  not \n drive  me  but  beating  someone  sure  as \n hell  does  I  actually  sted  my  agency  and \n took  that  marketing  course  because  I  saw \n someone  with  way  less  experience  than  me \n doing  it  so  I  took  that  negative  emotion \n and  Ted  into  an  Avenue  for  potential \n growth  and  even  now  pursuing  YouTube  was \n something  I  always  wanted  in  fact  it's \n in  my  dream  chart  from  2020  I've  always \n aspired  to  it  but  I  didn't  go  all  in \n until  I  saw  a  friend  of  mine  doing  it  it \n pissed  me  off  so  much  that  he  was  doing \n something  that  I  always  wanted  to  do  but \n I  had  given  myself  every  excuse  not  to \n so  within  a  few  weeks  of  seeing  him \n doing  I  started  posting  on  YouTube  so  I \n could  beat  him  and  if  you  want  to  help \n me  do  that  please  subscribe  to  my \n channel  and  like  this  video  no  worries \n if  not  just  know  that  I  will  remember \n this  forever  now  carrying  on  I  turned  my \n wi  them  mentality  into  how  can  I  do  it \n mindset  there  are  people  with  less \n experience  than  you  doing  the  thing  that \n you  want  to  do  because  they  believed  in \n themselves  enough  and  took  action  but \n the  problem  with  this  at  the  time  for  me \n was  that  I  still  lacked  belief  in  myself \n so  in  order  to  find  that  belief  I \n entered  one  of  the  most  intense  yet \n effective  periods  of  my  self-improvement \n journey  this  is  stage  three  Improvement \n so  just  for  context  at  this  point  I  had \n been  diagnosed  with  BPD  depression  PTSD \n High  performing  anxiety  be  eating  all  of \n it  I  was  in  therapy  with  various  doctors \n and  I  saw  no  progress  I  had  tried  and \n failed  at  a  few  business  ideas  and  on \n top  of  all  of  that  we  were  stuck  in  the \n middle  of  Co  I  was  stuck  in  my  childhood \n home  back  to  family  Rules  and  I  felt \n like  my  life  was  going  backwards  forced \n to  stay  inside  I  looked  at  myself  in  the \n mirror  and  I  decided  I  didn't  want  to \n remain  in  this  box  I  was  being  put  in \n when  my  personal  reality  was  impacting \n my  personality  making  me  a  victim  so \n instead  in  all  the  darkness  I  chose  to \n see  opportunity  and  that  opportunity  was \n to  go  all  in  on  me  because  I  had  nothing \n else  to  lose  I  went  into  full  monk  mode \n this  single  mindset  Chef  put \n self-improvement  as  a  top  priority  in  my \n brain  so  we  started  picking  up  signals \n which  were  in  alignment  with  that  my \n thoughts  started  to  slowly  align  to  this \n new  goal  improving  me  whatever  that \n meant  and  this  is  not  some  woo  woo \n medicine  it's  actually  Neuroscience  it's \n called  the  reticular  activating  system \n RAS  a  part  of  our  brain  that  filters \n information  based  on  what  we  deem \n important  by  setting  a  clear  intention  I \n prime  my  Ras  to  spot  everything  that \n aligned  with  my  new  goal  self \n Improvement  so  at  home  I  started  finding \n all  these  books  on  business  religion \n mindset  that  I'd  never  seen  before  and \n even  online  when  I  was  looking  for \n anything  I'd  find  myself  deep  down  in \n the  work  of  Bob  Proctor  Joe  dispenser \n Andrew  humanman  and  so  on  taking \n everything  they  said  in  like  a  sponge  I \n created  this  new  routine  no  drinking \n daily  exercise  daily  meditation  reading \n journaling  little  too  no  social  media \n and  not  really  seeing  anyone  besides  my \n family  I  must  mention  though  this  was \n incredibly  easy  for  me  since  we  were \n forced  to  stay  at  home  during  2021  but \n even  with  all  all  of  that  I  still  felt \n stuck  I  was  progressing  mentally  I  felt \n different  but  my  reality  remained  the \n same  I  was  doing  all  the  work  intally \n but  was  still  trying  different  business \n models  failing  at  them  charging  the  bare \n minimum  at  my  parents  house  and  away \n from  my  dream  reality  still  hated  the \n way  I  looked  my  clothes  didn't  fit  and \n some  days  I  felt  good  some  days  I  felt \n bad  volatile  mood  swings  I  didn't \n understand  anything  and  I  felt  so \n uncomfortable  with  where  I  was  in  life \n and  that's  exactly  what  self-improvement \n is  meant  to  do  to  you  because  on  one \n hand  you  have  all  of  these  authors \n telling  you  to  just  changed  and  in  the \n other  there  you  are  not  changing  at  all \n frustrated  with  all  of  this  effort  and \n fed  up  I  gave  myself  a  deadline  I  said \n to  myself  I  want  to  go  back  to \n University  and  do  a  master's  degree  and \n prove  to  myself  that  I'm  somewhat  smart \n and  can't  get  into  my  dream  universities \n because  at  that  time  all  I  wanted  to  do \n was  learn  I  honestly  didn't  think  I \n could  ever  make  it  as  an  entrepreneur \n and  consistently  learning  new  things  was \n something  I  truly  enjoyed  so  I  did  the \n one  thing  I  never  thought  I'd  do  in  that \n last  Cry  for  Help  I  pray  to  God  I'm  not \n religious  I  was  raised  atheist  and  I \n never  talked  about  this  before  anywhere \n but  I  promised  him  to  leave  my  old  life \n behind  completely  at  the  time  it  was  a \n very  hot  ass  because  that  was  all  I  knew \n and  loved  the  people  the  potties  the \n alcohol  the  lifestyle  I  said  take  it \n I'll  go  and  create  a  new  life  worth \n living  to  you  and  of  course  by  my  family \n so  with  that  decision  made  I  took  my \n first  positive  step  I  went  to  open  a  new \n LinkedIn  account  to  get  references  for \n University  as  I  needed  them  for  my \n applications  and  so  I  went  to  spend  some \n time  on  the  platform  and  realized  how \n much  it  had  changed  since  I  last  deleted \n it  the  year  prior  people  were  going \n crazy  viral  and  posting  content  that \n could  have  easily  been  an  Instagram  post \n my  curiosity  got  the  best  of  me  and  for \n the  next  few  weeks  I  analyzed  it \n obsessively  I  had  Google  Docs  open  notes \n and  YouTube  videos  on  my  watch  list  and \n that  is  where  I  unlocked  stage  number \n four  hyper  Focus  I  found  the  best \n creators  the  content  styles  that  I  like \n and  started  drafting  some  content  and \n adding  connection  so  I  could  at  least \n get  500  plus  since  I  had  zero  I  was \n weirdly  obsessed  with  LinkedIn  instantly \n drawn  to  it  for  some  reason  and  then  on \n a  random  Sunday  in  the  middle  of  May  my \n post  went  viral  300,000  Impressions  and \n 4,000  likes  and  trust  me  when  I  say  this \n in  life  nothing  happens  than  everything \n happens  all  at  once  next  thing  I  know  I \n was  spending  my  time  talking  to  new \n people  on  the  platform  making  new \n like-minded  friends  and  investing  time \n into  something  that  had  some  purpose \n they  had  the  depth  that  I  was  seeking \n which  I  found  on  books  and  journaling \n but  never  in  another  person  the  year \n prior  I  had  read  so  much  but  didn't  have \n many  people  to  talk  about  it  with  and \n now  I  felt  like  I  finally  found  my \n people  I  was  changing  slowly  I  don't \n think  I  even  noticed  it  at  the  time  and \n it  all  came  from  being  hyperfocused  and \n obsessed  with  one  thing  and  one  thing \n only  LinkedIn  and  then  one  day  I  woke  up \n to  an  email  an  acceptance  letter  to  my \n dream  University  and  suddenly  all  the \n discomfort  that  I  had  gone  through  up \n until  that  point  made  so  much  sense \n because  God  won't  ever  give  you  peace  in \n something  he  never  meant  for  you  to \n settle  in  but  there  was  one  piece  of  the \n musle  still  missing  and  it  took  other \n people  to  help  me  realize  it  and  that \n was  stage  number  five  confirmation  so \n all  my  life  I've  always  had  massive \n insecurity  I  never  felt  like  I'd  ever  be \n good  enough  that's  probably  why  I  needed \n the  validation  of  building  a  business  or \n getting  a  master's  degree  I  was \n consistently  chasing  the  next  big  thing \n that  could  potentially  make  me  feel \n worthy  but  in  that  Pursuit  I  found \n people  who  believed  in  me  even  when  I \n didn't  I  speak  about  this  often  but  I \n found  my  first  ever  Mentor  by  accident \n he  was  just  somebody  who  over  time \n offered  help  shed  his  knowledge  and  led \n me  to  a  solution  and  I  always  wondered \n why  me  why  is  this  milona  literally \n giving  me  his  time  for  free  and  then  I \n met  other  people  who  did  exactly  the \n same  for  me  people  I  admired  were \n treating  me  with  the  same  respect  I \n would  treat  them  and  welcomed  me  into \n their  world  the  validation  I  pursued  in \n business  I  got  from  my  new  friendships \n they  pushed  me  to  new  levels  every  day \n they  called  me  out  on  my  BS  they  looked \n at  my  work  and  gave  me  feedback  all \n completely  for  free  the  privilege  of \n being  accepted  by  these  people  had  such \n a  pivotal  impact  on  how  I  received \n myself  and  helped  me  confirm  all  the \n work  that  I  had  been  doing  on  myself \n that  year  I  went  from  extremely  insecure \n and  shy  to  slowly  growing  into  myself \n because  they  sold  me  for  who  I  was  and \n accepted  me  for  it  and  since  they  had  so \n much  faith  in  me  then  I  started  to \n exceed  the  expectations  that  I  had  for \n myself  because  I  felt  like  I  needed  to \n show  up  for  them  I  needed  to  be  the \n person  that  they  saw  me  as  so  to  do  this \n well  I  focused  on  writing  outstanding \n content  on  LinkedIn  every  post  needed  to \n be  clear  specific  and  actionable  which \n led  me  to  build  an  undeniable  personal \n brand  as  a  result  second  I  made \n Financial  progress  on  my  business  I  had \n access  to  three  of  the  best  Minds  on  the \n platform  they  gave  me  their  entire \n playbooks  on  lead  generation  writing  and \n content  it  was  my  duty  to  Simply  execute \n and  if  then  if  I  had  a  question  for  them \n I  made  sure  a  sell  that  there  was  proof \n of  me  applying  what  they  were  teaching \n me  because  respect  is  everything  in  this \n game  going  from  zero  to  six  figures \n wasn't  because  of  me  it  was  because  of \n them  and  the  third  thing  I  did  is  that  I \n networked  a  lot  you  see  there's  a  hidden \n currency  people  fail  to  see  in  that  is \n access  social  access  becoming  close  to \n these  mentors  gave  me  access  to  their \n Network  and  again  all  I  needed  to  do  was \n look  good  I  put  myself  out  of  my  comfort \n so  networked  a  lot  even  with  their \n friends  and  became  acquainted  with  them \n building  even  more  leverage  for  me  over \n time  and  as  a  result  of  all  of  this \n compounding  networking  sales \n implementations  growth  I  was  able  to \n give  back  to  them  this  was  either  in \n friendships  or  I  was  able  to  pay  some  of \n them  to  be  my  coaches  and  to  be  honest \n they  truly  wanted  me  to  succeed  so \n seeing  me  Implement  what  they  told  me \n was  enough  of  them  too  and  that  brings \n me  to  today  I  become  the  person  that  I \n once  wrote  about  running  marathons \n creating  content  just  like  this  building \n businesses  and  honestly  being  surrounded \n by  people  who  make  me  feel  alive  it's \n all  I  truly  ever  wanted  I  feel  so  rich \n rich  in  friendships  rich  in  time  rich  in \n love  and  rich  in  health  and  I  always  get \n asked  what's  next  in  my  journey  or \n career  or  whatever  it  is  that  I'm  doing \n and  all  I  want  is  to  Simply  live  in  the \n present  moment  because  all  I've  ever \n done  up  until  this  point  is  run  running \n towards  the  goal  and  running  against  the \n anti-  vision  of  me  but  finally  I  feel  at \n home  and  I  think  that  is  the  most \n priceless  thing  and  something  worth \n being  in  the  present  for  so  telling  you \n this  story  all  I  really  want  to  say  is \n you  can  truly  change  your  life  in  one \n year  if  you  decide  to  turn  all  your  pain \n into  strength  you  can  literally  see \n every  single  negative  thing  that's  ever \n happened  to  you  and  turn  it  into  an \n opportunity  to  grow  move  out  from  where \n you  live  make  new  friends  remove \n everything  that  no  longer  aligns  with \n you  try  new  things  stack  your  skills \n build  a  parle  brand  online  fix  your  own \n problems  then  solve  it  for  other  people \n and  then  charge  for  it  that  is  literally \n the  game  plan  all  you  have  to  do  is \n follow  it  and  if  you  are  where  I  was  a \n few  years  ago  and  you  need  someone  to \n believe  in  you  just  like  I  did  know  that \n I  do  just  push  through  this  and  know \n that  there  is  so  much  space  for  you  here \n and  obviously  if  you  want  an  actionable \n piece  of  advice  then  post  on  LinkedIn  it \n may  as  well  change  your  life  too  also \n I'm  so  big  on  self-education  I  don't \n think  I'd  be  anywhere  if  it  wasn't  for \n the  knowledge  I  accumulated  along  the \n way  and  if  you  want  to  succeed  in \n business  then  the  right  know  will  help \n you  get  that  quickly  if  you  want  to \n follow  a  similar  path  to  me  with  all  the \n self-education  I  took  on  then  check  out \n this  video  to  find  out  which  books  help \n me  change  my  life  see  you  there",
