  "transcript": "this  is  a  month's  worth  of  viral \n LinkedIn  content  and  these  are  the  three \n simple  AI  prompts  I  used  to  generate  it \n in  literally  10  minutes  and  over  the \n last  year  I've  seen  the  smartest  of \n entrepreneurs  use  them  to  get  ahead \n generating  leads  gaining  new  followers \n and  writing  viral  Post  in  seconds \n without  sounding  generic  so  if  you  want \n to  know  their  secret  then  you  need  to \n watch  this  video  look  every  YouTube \n channel  has  told  you  to  start  using  AI \n to  write  your  content  and  you  should  and \n today  I'm  going  to  show  you  the  best \n Plug  and  Play  prompts  that  bring  you  the \n quickest  results  for  your  personal  brand \n so  how  do  I  know  this  well  offer  in \n hundreds  of  viral  and  lead  generating \n posts  for  myself  clients  and  even  some \n of  the  biggest  brands  that  you'll  see \n online  on  LinkedIn  I've  also  grown  and \n scaled  my  own  following  to  170,000  in  2 \n years  so  I  can  honestly  tell  you  what \n works  when  it  comes  to  content  that \n builds  a  real  and  authentic  brand  while \n growing  your  following  and  increasing \n sales  and  what  doesn't  creating  content \n online  has  become  a  necessity  especially \n if  you're  a  business  owner  entrepreneur \n or  just  starting  out  and  it's  exactly \n how  my  friend  J  is  driving  leads  daily \n for  her  new  startup  and  how  my  friend \n Izzy  landed  her  dream  role  in  fashion \n and  according  to  FS  by  2027  the  Creator \n economy  is  estimated  to  be  worth  $480 \n billion  meaning  that  your  online \n personal  brand  becomes  the  employee  that \n never  sleeps  as  more  and  more  people  are \n online  it  gives  you  the  ability  to  be \n discovered  24/7  without  being  physically \n present  so  before  you  go  and  hire  an \n overpriced  agency  to  do  it  for  you  he's \n a  three-step  chipd  prompting  sequence \n you  need  to  create  content  on  LinkedIn \n consistently  and  it  it  all  starts  with \n positioning  yourself  as  the  number  one \n expert  for  your  ideal  client  or  audience \n and  my  first  step  to  doing  this  is \n identifying  exactly  what  relevant  and \n valuable  content  looks  like  for  your \n specific  business  whether  you're  a  coach \n lawyer  accountant  or  a  brick-and  m  to \n business  figuring  this  out  shouldn't  be \n difficult  the  problem  with  all  these \n other  AI  content  systems  is  that  they \n tell  you  to  focus  on  posting  behind  the \n scenes  content  or  giving  value  this  is \n actually  too  broad  fluffy  and  doesn't \n add  any  Authority  or  trust  and  sure  your \n loyal  customer  wants  to  know  what  you're \n doing  after  work  but  when  you're \n creating  content  on  platforms  like \n LinkedIn  or  even  x  with  billions  of \n users  who  don't  know  like  or  trust  you \n you  need  to  make  sure  that  your  first \n impression  counts  meaning  that  you  need \n to  understand  most  people  don't  know  who \n you  are  or  what  you  do  to  fix  this  we're \n going  to  hop  onto  chat  gbt  and  inser  the \n fast  prompt  to  build  your  unique  content \n system  for  this  we're  going  to  be  using \n my  friend  Mark  who  is  in  B2B  as  an \n example  The  Prompt  is  give  me  five \n themes  or  topics  for  social  media  for  my \n B2B  growth  cont  company  for  example  my \n entrepreneur  friend  who  runs  an  agency \n has  one  personal  branding  two \n copyrighting  three  entrepreneurship  and \n four  sales  ask  her  content  pist  and  her \n business  and  brandner  around  that  what \n would  they  be  for  me  for  a  little  bit \n more  context  here's  my  mission  statement \n and  then  you  add  the  mission  statement \n for  this  we're  going  to  add  marks  we \n build  a  full  service  marketing  campaign \n based  around  virtual  events  that  help \n you  dominate  your  space  and  generate \n leads  for  your  business  all  I  did  for \n this  is  go  to  his  website  and  literally \n grab  the  first  line  I  saw  it's  so  simple \n okay  now  we  let  it  generate  this  prompt \n is  optimized  to  give  you  the  almighty \n content  pillars  we  all  know  you  need  to \n create  content  on  LinkedIn  and  any  other \n social  media  platform  without  the  cringy \n fluff  or  the  corporate  jargon  that  you \n can  smell  from  a  mile  away  now  you  have \n four  amazing  content  pillars  with  a  lot \n of  detail  too  the  next  part  is

\n using  real  LinkedIn  post  so  chpd  can \n have  an  accurate  Baseline  to  create \n content  to  the  level  that  you're  looking \n for  now  the  second  prompt  is  stop \n publishing  new  blog  content  I  see  too \n many  websites  with  hundreds  of  block \n posts  that  get  new  traffic  yet  they're \n still  publishing  four  plus  new  posts  per \n month  if  you  already  have  existing \n content  do  this  instead  then  after  that \n we  continue  the  prompt  saying  make  sure \n the  hul  follows  the  following  format  a \n bold  statement  that  is  no  longer  than \n eight  words  in  sentence  one  a  sentence \n that  starts  with  the  words  here  are  and \n the  number  to  start  a  step  by-step  lisal \n for  sentence  two  please
