  "transcript": "all  right  so  I  I've  reviewed  the  iPhone \n 16e  recently  and  you  know  what  I  noticed \n is  it  got  a  lot  of  hate  there  are  a  lot \n of  people  who  really  don't  like  the \n phone  and  that  kind  of  got  us  thinking \n about  all  the  other  iPhones  that  have \n gotten  hate  over  the  years  and  whether \n they  deserve  it  or  not  so  we're  going  to \n power  rank  them  that  is  the  most \n expensive  phone  in  the  world  in  the \n world  I  crap  crap  colors  are  hideous \n there's  literally  nothing  groundbreaking \n here  in  the  iPhone  you  know  it's  so \n gigantic  and  yet  it  bends  if  it's  in \n your  pocket  720  ft  in  2018  I  die  who  are \n [Music] \n you  so  that  is  an  original  iphone  that \n is  old  so  the  first  yeah  believe  it  or \n not  the  first  iPhone  did  get  some  hate \n well  this  thing  cost  the  same  as  a  PS3 \n it  will  be  semi  obsolete  by  the  time  it \n comes  out  no  thanks  I  don't  get  it  who's \n going  to  want  a  phone  that's  as  large  as \n an  iPod  and  looks  like  an  iPod  sure  it \n worked  for  music  but  for  a  phone  yeah \n this  will  never  catch  on  now  I  don't \n remember  exactly  but  I  want  to  say  this \n was  this  was  a  $500  phone  when  it  first \n got  unveiled  which  at  the  time  in  2007 \n was  even  more  crazy  than  it  is  now  and \n that's  where  a  lot  of  the  initial  hate \n came  from  I  think  the  rest  of  the  hate \n on  this  phone  is  retroactive  Vin  you \n took  this  home  played  around  with  the \n camera  did  whatever  you  could  with  you \n know  in  2025  what  were  your  impressions \n it's  a  really  small  phone  uh  even \n smaller  than  a  12  mini  so  these  are  the \n photos  I  was  able  to  take  off  of  it  this \n is  a  behind  the  scenes  from  the  Oppo \n phone  we  shot  as  you  can  tell  it \n basically  looks  like  there's  a  couple \n Cindy  Bloom  filters  stacked  on  top  of \n each  other  yeah  carrier  exclusive \n expensive  two  basic  of  features  no \n keyboard  recessed  headphone  jack  there \n yeah  this  okay  I  feel  like  I  would  agree \n with  that  that's  I  think  we  can  move \n these  frisbee  catch  all  right  I  remember \n this  one  this  is  the  5c  so  by  the  time \n we  had  the  5c  this  was  a  place  in  their \n lineup  to  have  a  cheaper  iPhone  and  a \n more  expensive  iPhone  cuz  5  5S  was  more \n expensive  5  C  C  was  colorful  and  cheap  C \n for  cheap  think  again  your  new  plastic \n whatever  they  say  it's  still  a  plastic \n ey  crap  crap  even  won't  be  sold  in \n reseller  Market  even  with  the  lame  case \n included  Logic  for  sure  C  and  iPhone  5  C \n means  crapple  it  was  it  was  plastic  it \n was  just  kind  of  cheaply  made  and  ugly \n we're  going  to  notice  a  pattern  here \n tell  me  if  this  sounds  familiar  for  a \n hundred  bucks  more  you  could  just  get  an \n iPhone  5S \n yeah  have  we  ever  have  we  ever  run  into \n this  issue  before  does  it  sound  familiar \n at  all  it  does  sound  familiar  I  don't \n love  the  I  don't  always  love  the  for  100 \n bucks  more  though  I  like  the  for  the \n same  price  you  could  but  for  100  bucks \n more  there's  always  going  to  be \n something  I  like  the  colors  I  thought  it \n was  fun  this  green  you  like  the  green \n too  this  is  the  Charlie  XCX  brat  green \n yellow  actually  yeah  do  you  remember  the \n cases  The  Croc  cases  they  were  awesome \n awesome  you  just  say  awesome \n crazy  I  hate  the  case  more  on  the  phone \n for  sure  oh  that  was  so  cool  I  thought \n they  were  fun  the  cck \n cases  would  you  say  it's  higher  or  lower \n than  the  original  iPhone  I  would \n say  it's  more  deserving  of  hate  I  think \n the  original  iPhone  is  still  a  legend  so \n maybe  this  is  here  and  this  is  here  for \n now  okay \n okay  okay  yeah  we  remember  this  one  oh \n it's  now  become  clear  apple  is  still \n working  out  some  bugs  few  people  say \n that  this  really  big  one  bented  and  they \n posted  pictures  the  notion  that  you  can \n bend  a  phone  who  cares  but  the  notion \n that  a  70  lb  butt  can  bend  a  phone  there \n are  70  lb  butts  in  the  world  I  mean  this \n was  my  first  gate  I've  ever  heard  of \n yeah  Bend  gate  it  was  L  there  was  a \n headline  about  somebody  who  sat  on  their \n phone  and  it  bent  in  their  pocket  and \n then  it  bent  in  another  phone  and \n another  pocket  and  another  pocket  and \n suddenly  it  was  like  a  big  deal  so  then \n Lou  goes  on  and  he's  like  does  this \n phone  actually  Bend  and  he  sits  there \n and  just  bends  the  thing  in  half \n everyone  goes  oh  and  because  the  regular \n six  didn't  bend  with  the  plus  bent  do \n you  want  to  guess  how  many  customers \n contacted  Apple  about  a  bent  iPhone  6 \n plus  30  maybe  like  30,000  according  to \n Apple  only  six  customers  contacted  Apple \n about  a  iPhone  6  according  to  Apple  this \n was  like  pretty  quickly  into  the \n controversy  and  I  I'm  sure  that  like \n they  probably  did  like  some  like \n finagling  to  be  like  oh  it  wasn't \n actually  cuz  it  was  bent  you  know  people \n were  sneaking  into  Apple  stores  with \n like  cameras  and  trying  to  bend  actual \n units  in  the  Apple  Store  and  as  we  were \n setting  up  the  set  someone  who  works \n here  tried  to  do  that  do  you  want  to \n guess  who  works  here  and  tried  to  bend \n in  an  iPhone  6  Plus  in  an  Apple  Store \n did  they  I  already  know  the  answer  but \n oh  in  an  Apple  store  was  it  you  rich  no \n was  it \n not  somebody  went  tried  to  on  camera  who \n had  a  camera  back  who  had  an  iPhone  back \n then  miles  probably  tried  it  no  who  was \n it  Brandon  Havard  oh  yeah  number  one \n apple  Lover  now  it  became  a  genre  on \n YouTube  to  durability  test  devices \n because  I  want  to  say  because  of  this \n gate  all  right  where  does  it  go \n gentlemen  I  think  it  goes  all  the  way  at \n the  end  that's  pretty  bad  yep  yep  V  yeah \n you  ready  vin  it's  it  comes  if  I  have  a \n lacr  I  think  I  can  catch \n it  oh  yeah  it  does  yeah  what  just  really \n sh  straight  through  my  chest  bro  I \n remember  a  lot  of  things  about  the \n iPhone  10  launching  so  first  of  all  this \n is  a  redesign  for  the  phone  no  home \n button  right \n OLED  gestures  first  time  for  a  lot  of \n stuff  on  the  iPhone  but  this  was \n entering  the  era  of  the  modern  iPhone  do \n you  remember  the  Samsung  commercials  oh \n yeah  the  hairline  yeah  I  do  damn  but \n this  was  also  the  $1,000  iPhone  This  was \n oh  that  was  the  that  was  the  main  tag \n line  cuz  they  launched  they  launched \n iPhone  8  at  the  same  time  and  it  looked \n like  the  old  phone  and  then  this  was \n like  by  the  way  one  more  thing  boom \n $1,000  phone  with  a  notch  and  so  it's \n the  easiest  one  to  make  fun  of  one  more \n thing  it  is  the  iPhone  expensive  you're \n paying  extra  for  the  future  but  there's \n literally  nothing  groundbreaking  here  in \n the  iPhone  I  think  of  this  phone  as  like \n the  Shrek  5  of  iPhones  in  a  way  it's \n technically  a  sequel  but  it  looks \n different  but  like  if  you  just  give  it  a \n shot  you  know  maybe  it  could  be  good  it \n was  a  necessary  update  like  we  would  not \n have  the  iPhones  now  without  this  one  it \n deserves  credit  for  birthing  the  modern \n iPhone  and  it  also  deserves  hate  for \n birthing  the  modern  price  tag  I  think  in \n the  middle  is  pretty \n fair  okay  you  need  helmets  yo  he  goes \n like  that's  a  that's  a  frisbee  toss  wa \n XR  I  do  not  remember  that  color  the \n price  is  higher  than  the  display \n resolution  bro  all  I  needed  to  he  is  no \n 1080P  and  I'm  out  this  is  a  classic \n didn't  deserve  that  much  hate  okay  so \n the  10r  comes  out  this  is  kind  of  like  a \n Reincarnation  of  the  5c  where  this  is  a \n cheaper  cut  down  version  while  they \n still  sell  a  more  expensive  one  yes  what \n did  they  cut  screen's  not  that  good  it's \n got  one  camera  oh  and  the  screen  was \n only  um  LCD  I  remember  John  from  TLD  he \n tried  to  do  a  blind  test  oh  to  see  what \n if  you  can  see  the  difference  in  quality \n yeah  so  he  put  like  a  10r  and  I  think  a \n 10  behind  like  some  cardboards  so  you \n couldn't  tell  which  phone  was  which  and \n just  asked  regular  people  to  tell  the \n difference  and  nobody  could  tell  the \n difference  deserves  the  least  hate  so \n does  OG  deserve  the  least  hate  yeah  this \n deserves  less  hate  than  all  of \n them  10  R  chos  just  want  to  let  you  know \n if  you  say  the  name  of  this  phone  three \n times  oh  yeah  a  goblin  cre  will  appear \n who  uses  it  by  day  and  sleeps  on  it  at \n night  yes  yes  nice  iPhone  12  mini  12 \n mini  12 \n mini  did  someone  call  oh  hey  not  only  do \n I  like  this  phone  I  think  I  told  the \n story  before  somewhere  the  last  time  I \n took  it  to  get  repaired  the  Apple  repair \n Tech  at  the  Apple  Store  was  like  I  took \n it  out  and  he  goes  ah  the  collector's \n iPhone  he  goes  is  that  there  that's  the \n champagne  of  iPhones  it's  the  most  o \n over  engineered  iPhone  as  far  as  like \n structural  stuff  goes  and  it's  the  most \n indestructible  one  they've  ever  made \n which  is  why  repair  techs  hate  working \n on  it  cuz  even  take  getting  it  open  is \n so  hard  and  that  makes  sense  cuz  I  do \n not  have  a  case  and  I  drop  my  phone  on \n the  sidewalk  literally  every  single  day \n uh  I  do  lose  40%  of  my  battery  life  by \n the  time  I  get  to  work  wait  yeah  40%  40% \n so  you  arrive  with  I  arrive  with  60%  how \n many  times  a  day  do  you  charge  all  day \n I'm  just  continuously  charging  okay  so \n this  getss  us  to  why  this  phone  is  hated \n yeah  because  small  phones  have  small \n batteries  mhm  you  know  what  honestly  I \n have  a  sof  spot  for  it  I  miss  small \n phones  like  I  I've  eulogized  smartphones \n getting  gigantic  in  the  past  couple \n years  like  the  Zen  phone's  gone  like  we \n just  don't  have  good  small  phones \n anymore  and  so  I  do  miss  this  I  still \n want  a  flagship  this  size  you  wouldn't \n you  like  the  13  mini  was  pretty  good \n battery  life  it  was  like  it  was  it  was \n double  digit  pretty  substantial \n improvements  yes  you  still  weren't \n rocking  a  13  mini  well  cuz  here's  the \n thing  they  also  had  a  Pro  and  I  use  that \n this  is  an  imaginary  phone  that  doesn't \n exist  but  if  you  could  give  me  all  of \n the  cameras  and  features  of  a  pro  phone \n in  a  small  size  like  a  mini  size  yes  I \n would  a  pro  Min  13  mini  was  better  right \n but  one  of  the  greatest  small  phones  of \n all  time  if  you're  thinking  about  buying \n a  used  iPhone  Mini  just  know  literally \n no  websites  or  apps  are  optimized  for \n this  screen  um  including  first  party \n Apple  apps  uh  a  lot  of  them  just \n straight  up  don't  work  also  um  weird  bug \n that  started  happening  with  the  last  OS \n update  when  you  open  the  camera  it \n defaults  to  slow-mo  mode  can't  explain \n that  one  the  more  you  describe  this \n horrible  situation  you're  in  the  more  it \n moves  up  the  ladder  it's  just  like  you \n give  it  people  see  it  and  they're  like \n whoa  especially  people  who  are  outside \n Tech  and  don't  remember  four  iPhones  ago \n and  are  just  like  yeah  wait  I've  never \n what  I  haven't  seen  a  phone  that  small \n in  a  while  so  uh  it's  the  best  I  think  I \n think  that's  all  my  time  here  I'll  uh \n see  everyone \n later  oh  my \n God  J  okay  our  final  our  final \n iPhone  this  is  the \n 2025  iPhone \n 16e  Ellis  but  it's \n $600  for  a  single  camera  no  mag  safe  60 \n HZ  phone  with  a  notch  in  2025  didn't \n this  come  out \n at  like  $600  or  $700  mhm  so  I  feel  like \n this  is  better  no  yeah  but  the  tech \n around  this  time  versus  the  tech  around \n this  time  there  are  articles  now  about \n how  this  has  like  really  low  sales  oh \n but  that's  the  thing  about  the  phone  for \n people  who  don't  care  about  phones  is \n they  don't  pre-order  phones  and  buy  it \n on  day  one  they  will  buy  it  all  year  and \n not  really  care  I'm  not  going  to  say  no \n I  think  no  one  should  buy  it  outright  at \n full  price  brand  new  yeah  and  it's  not  a \n bad  it's  a  fine  phone  for  that  there's \n nothing  wrong  with  the  phone  something's \n wrong  with  the \n phone  something's  wrong  with  the  phone \n price  really  really  high  but  still  fine \n this  probably  should  be  higher  because \n it  was  the  originator  yeah  it  said  a  lot \n of  the  it  was  the  originator  but  didn't \n work  with  a  lot  of  headphones  this  why \n do  we  not  like  this  it's  just  ugly  some \n might  say \n that  and  uh  the \n pricing  100  bucks  if  we're  talking  about \n for  the  price \n and  like  where  it  sits  on  the  ladder  you \n could  have  bought  an  a  previous \n generation  iPhone  mhm  with  the  exact \n same  specs  for  cheaper  or  the  same  price \n as  the  iPhone  5c  with  better  Hardware \n does  that  not  sound  like  the  exact  same \n issue  as  the  iPhone  16  later  so  I  think \n it \n does  that's  what  I'll \n do  because  this  one's  not  ugly  and  it's \n true  and  this  one  is  ugly  and  it's  true \n all  right  well  there  you  have  it  that's \n our  list  if  you  want  to  see  more  of  Vin \n click  Vin",
