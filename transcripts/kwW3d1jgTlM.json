  "transcript": "I  got  five  YouTube  creators  to  compete \n against  each  other  in  this  Albertson \n store.  Each  of  them  will  earn  points  by \n competing  in  seven  challenges.  And  the \n one  who  has  the  most  points  at  the  end \n of  this  video  will  win  $200,000  for \n charity.  Welcome  to  the  first  challenge. \n Oh  my  gosh.  While  wearing  these  goggles \n that  give  you  almost  no  visibility  at \n all,  each  contestant  must  make  it  to  the \n other  side  of  the  aisle  by  walking  on \n the  floating  cliff  bars.  If  they  fall \n off  wall  crossing,  they  will  have  to \n restart  until  they  do  make  it  across. \n The  first  person  to  make  it  across  wins \n the  highest  amount  of  points.  Also,  one \n more  thing  I  forgot  to  mention.  The \n floor  is  lava.  So,  I'm  going  to  take  it \n slow  and  easy  and  just  try  to  get  to  the \n finish  line  without  having  to  reset \n anything.  All  right.  Okay.  Oh,  shoot. \n Yeah.  All  right,  baby.  Let's  go. \n I  need  to  just  drown  everybody  else  out \n and  just  focus. \n I'm  not  going  to  win.  I  thought  I  had  a \n strategy,  but  I  guess  my  strategy  was \n stepping  on  the  lava. \n I'm  so  annoyed.  Just  a  dumb  mistake.  I'm \n frustrated.  All right,  I  got  to  pick  up. \n I  feel  like  they're  behind  me. \n Wait,  did  I  make  it?  I  made  it. \n Oh  my  god.  You  got  it.  You  got  it.  Wait, \n can  I  just  jump?  You  can.  Maybe. \n A  cliff  bar  hates  to  see  me \n coming.  God  dang.  Oh  my  god.  I  only  have \n two  points.  I  have  to  come  out  first \n because  if  I  don't,  I'm  going  to  be \n last. \n This  next  challenge  might  not  be  the \n fairest  for  some  of  the  contestants.  Oh \n my.  Okay.  Wait,  there's  a  time  limit. \n Look,  3  minutes.  Next  is  the  Zoa  energy \n drink  challenge.  They  will  have  3 \n minutes  to  stack  Zoa  cans  as  high  as \n possible.  Whoever  has  the  tallest  tower \n at  the  end  wins.  You're  so  much  taller. \n You  have  such  an  advantage.  I  can't  even \n reach  that  wall.  I  mean,  I'm  both  the \n tallest  person  here  and  a  building \n creator.  Yeah,  you're  This  is  going  to \n be  embarrassing.  Sorry.  My  hands  have \n been  so  shaky,  too.  This  is  not  okay.  Oh \n my  gosh.  They're  all  nice,  but  you  know, \n I'm  trying  to  win  this.  Oh  my  gosh.  I \n think  Sarah,  she's  playing  this  innocent \n card.  If  I  just  keep  getting  second \n place  and  Sarah  doesn't  get  first  place, \n we're  in  the  lead.  And  that's  good.  We \n not  really  move  that  fast.  You  know what \n I  mean?  You  go  a  little  slow  here.  I \n should  have  played  with  more  Legos  as  a \n kid. \n Oh  no.  Oh  my  god,  that  went  by  so  fast. \n Oh  my  gosh,  I  did  not  expect  that.  Calm \n down.  I'm  literally  shaking.  Like,  I \n need  to  just  calm  down  and  focus.  I'm \n doubting  myself,  not  going  to  lie.  No. \n No.  Dang  it.  Trying  to  decide  whether  to \n just  keep  it  as  is  or  try  to  put  more \n on.  I'm  going  to  stabilize  the  base  and \n if  one  of  these  guys  get  taller,  then \n I'll  add  more  on.  28  seconds.  We  have \n less  than  30  seconds  left.  I  can't  go  up \n anymore  unless  I  just  try  to  do  one  on \n the  end. \n No,  that's  not \n good.  That's  not  You  know what?  I'll \n take  the  L  on  this.  I'll  take  the  L. \n I'll  take  the  L.  I'll  take  the  L.  I'll \n take  the  L. \n Let  mine  go.  I'll  take  the  L.  Let  it  go. \n It  was  You  have  to  let  it  go,  Rebecca. \n You  can't  keep  holding  it.  Wait,  it \n didn't. \n Oh  my  gosh,  I  feel  terrible.  Does  that \n count?  I  won  it  until  yours  fell  over \n and  crushed  mine.  David  should  have  had \n first  place.  Rebecca's  tower  fell  into \n his  and  it  made  me  have  second  place. \n Okay,  sorry.  It  fell  over  there.  Theirs \n was  so  much  taller  than  mine.  Like  there \n was  no  way.  Hey,  it's  okay.  It's  part  of \n the  game.  And  I  feel  like  Beast \n Philanthropy  is  really  setting  that \n precedent  for  creators  to  help  make  the \n world  a  better  place.  Now  that  I'm  in  a \n space  where  I  can  actually  compete  on \n behalf  of  a  charity.  I  can't  believe \n that  girl. \n There's  no  way. \n For  this  challenge,  whoever  presses \n their  buzzer  first  gets  a  turn.  There \n are  12  possible  combinations,  and  you \n will  each  go  one  at  a  time.  picking  two \n numbers  that  will  match  the  pictures \n behind  and  you'll  receive  two  points  for \n every  combination  you  guess  right.  But \n if  you  guess  wrong,  you  will  lose  two \n points. \n 17  and  five. \n Yes.  Yes.  That's  what  we  needed.  I'm \n still  second  place.  I'm  still  good. \n Sarah's  the  still  the  target.  Uh  11  and \n 22. \n This  challenge  turned  out  to  be  more \n difficult  than  they  expected. \n Oh  no,  I'm  done.  So,  the  contestants \n decided  to  work  together  to  minimize  the \n risk  of  losing  too  many  points.  If \n everybody  wants  to  go,  it'll  still  be \n rapid  fire,  but  if  no  one  wants  to  go, \n we'll  have  to  go  down  the  line.  We  have \n to  go  down  the line  and  we'll  sacrifice \n ourselves. \n 21  and  13. \n Oh,  yeah.  Good  job.  Good  job. \n 17  and  four. \n Nice. \n Oh  my  god.  Sarah  is  so  lucky. \n Five  and  16. \n Oh,  she  got  it. \n Wow. \n You  got  to  definitely  be  in  the  finals. \n Oh  my  god. \n What  the  hell,  man? \n Two  and  18.  Give  me  something.  There  we \n go,  baby.  Let's  go.  I'm  on  the  board. \n I'm  on  I'm  on  the  board.  I'm  on  the \n board.  I'm  on  the  board.  15  and  nine. \n Yep.  Nice.  I  knew  that  one.  Oh,  okay. \n Go,  go,  go.  I'll  I'll  take  one.  I  I \n haven't  gone.  She's  like,  I  have  so  many \n points.  Well,  we  said  we  were  going  down \n the  line  and  I  want  to  honor  that. \n Sarah's  the  one  to  beat  right  now.  I \n think  we  all  should  be  looking  at  her \n and  watching  her  because  if  it  comes \n down  to  it,  she's  going  to  get  so  far \n ahead  of  us,  we  won't  be  able  to  catch \n her. \n 22  and  7. \n I  love  that. \n 22  and  14.  I  think  she  got  it.  She  got \n it. \n I  might  be  wrong.  I  don't  remember.  I \n don't  remember.  Seven  of  14.  Let's  go. \n All  right,  I  guess.  No  one  else  is \n happy.  Okay. \n 20  and  22. \n Oh,  the  Okay. \n Okay.  Six  and  22.  Nice. \n What? \n Unbelievable.  How  nice.  Good  job, \n Rebecca.  That  was  That  was  rough. \n All  right.  I  feel  like  these  past \n challenges  I've  been  doing  so  good \n because  it's  like  a  lot  of  skill.  This \n is  literally  just  kind  of  like  guessing. \n I'm  skiing.  And  you  people.  Now  y'all \n get  to  give  some.  The  contestants  will \n now  be  playing  Triscuit  turntable.  To \n uncover  the  secret  phase,  they'll  each \n take  turns  to  guess  a  letter.  Every \n correct  letter  earns  a  spin  on  the  wheel \n for  extra  points.  If  they  guess  the \n phrase  correctly,  they  will  win  the  game \n and  earn  10  points.  But  every  time  they \n guess  the  phrase  wrong,  five  points  will \n be  deducted.  I'd  like  to  buy  a  vow. \n I  All right,  let's  see  it.  Let's  see  it. \n Come  on.  Oh.  Oh. \n That's  just  one.  Give  me  the  eye.  Give \n me  five.  0  0 \n zero \n zero  zero  zero  zero.  I  felt  bad  because \n for  Kenigra  we  were  like  kind  of  uh  like \n rooting  for  her  to  not  get  any  points.  I \n think  all  of  the  contestants  are  feeling \n nervous  because  all  of  these  charities \n mean  a  lot  to  us.  So  all  of  us  really \n want  to  win.  Can  I  get  an  E?  Oh,  that's \n a  good  one.  That's  good.  That's  good. \n About  that \n one.  Oh,  two.  Oh  my  gosh.  Give  me \n points.  Oh,  no  points.  Zero.  Zero  zero \n 0. \n Someone's  back  there.  If  she  gets \n another  five,  I'm  quitting.  Come  on. \n Come  on.  No.  Don't  zero.  Yes.  All right. \n I'll  take  it.  I'll  take  it.  I'll  take \n it.  This  is  a  high  stakes  competition. \n Logically,  it  would  make  sense  to,  you \n know,  just  not  stress,  but  it's  hard  not \n to.  I  really  want  to  show  up  and \n perform.  S.  No.  S's.  Crazy,  dude.  What \n kind  of  words  don't  have  any  S's  in \n them?  A.  Give  me  the  green.  There  we  go. \n Give  me  two.  Give  me  three.  Oh  my  god. \n I'll  take  two.  I'll  take  two.  I  got  Come \n on.  Come  on.  Oh,  come  on.  Oh,  that's \n two.  That's  a  two.  All right.  Now,  give \n me  a  five.  And  then  I  don't  need  any \n more  points  after  this.  Come  on. \n Yes.  That's  what  I  want.  That's  what  I \n want.  Let's  go.  Thank  you  for  that.  I \n need  I  would  like  to  guess.  Whoa.  Wow. \n Whole  grain  wheat. \n What? \n Coming  into  this,  I  genuinely  thought  I \n was  going  to  be  the  worst  contestant  and \n I  somehow  I  keep  winning  and  I'm  just  so \n grateful.  I  honestly  thought  I  was  going \n to  lose.  No,  you  didn't.  I  was. \n So,  call  Sarah  whole  grain  cuz  she's  on \n a  roll. \n Cut  that  one  off.  Was  S  not  a  good \n choice?  I  like  this. \n [Music] \n We  said  this.  Who  came?  Someone  guessed \n it.  Yes,  someone  guessed  it.  The  next \n game  is  sparkling  ice  bowling.  Each \n contestant  gets  one  shot  to  knock  over \n as  many  pins  as  possible.  The  one  with \n the  most  knockdown  wins  the  challenge. \n This  is  a  chance  for  anyone  to  take  the \n lead.  At  any  point,  the  tables  can  turn. \n I  just  need  to  make  second  place  so  that \n I  can  be  in  the  final  round.  Negra.  Good \n luck,  Negro.  Let's  go. \n Oh  my  goodness.  Oh,  okay. \n All  right.  A  bowling  pin  hates  to  see  me \n coming.  Here  we  go.  I  don't  I  don't want \n to  get  hit.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh  my.  Are  you \n freaking  Your  boy  can't  bowl.  Is  there \n anything  else  to  say?  I  mean,  if  I  were \n David,  I'd  be  pretty  disappointed. \n Becca,  you  have  so  nervous  for  her. \n Okay.  I'm  nervous  right  now. \n Oh,  that's  good.  That  was  straight  on. \n That  was  straight  on.  I  like  that.  I \n like  that.  I  wish  I  was  stronger.  It \n makes  me  want  to  like  lift  weights  or \n something.  Watch  the  strike.  Watch  this. \n It's  going  to  be  a  strike. \n Oh  gosh.  So  much  fun.  Yeah.  The  strategy \n to  run.  That's  good.  I  like  that. \n Strike. \n Not  bad.  Not  bad.  Yeah,  this  challenge  I \n need  to  win  or  at least  get  second  place \n if  I  want  to  even  think  about  going  to \n the  final  challenge. \n Here  I  go.  Here  we  go.  Bro's  just \n stalling. \n That's  not  good.  What? \n That's  not  good.  That's  not  good.  I \n thought  the  guys  were  going  to  dominate \n this  challenge  and  I  cannot  believe  that \n neither  of  them  did  well.  The  girls  were \n feeling,  you  know,  Yeah.  For  one  of \n these  contestants,  winning  $200,000 \n means  more  than  you  think  because  they \n are  not  competing  for  themselves.  So, \n I'm  competing  for  nourishing  neighbors. \n They  find  the  spaces  where  hunger  exists \n and  then  work  to  provide  food  to  those \n spaces  to  break  the  cycle  of  hunger.  I'm \n going  to  be  donating  the  money  to \n American  Cancer  Society.  I  chose  Sharing \n Excess.  What  they're  doing  is  working \n with  everyone  that  they  can  to  make  sure \n that  the  food  that  we  just  waste  go  to \n the  people  that  needs  it.  I'm  competing \n for  Salvation  Army.  They  help  with  the \n homelessness  in  America.  The  charity \n that  I  chose  was  Hope  for  Fertility.  It \n gives  grants  to  families  who  are  unable \n to  have  children  on  their  own.  It's  not \n about  me.  I  have  to  win  for  the  charity \n and  for  this  cause.  Sharing  excess.  I  am \n going  to  win. \n Next  up  is  the  Uts  Chip  Taste  Challenge. \n They  will  each  be  blindfolded  and  given \n five  flavors  to  taste  out  of  the  10 \n options  that  were  provided  to  the \n contestants.  a  correct  guess  and  you  get \n five  points,  which  means  there  is  a \n possibility  of  earning  25  points  in  this \n challenge.  It  is  now  anyone's \n game.  I  feel  the  texture.  This  is  sour \n cream. \n [Music] \n Watchmant  a  smell. \n You  know,  I  don't  think  it  was  quite \n spicy  enough  to  be  red  hot.  So,  I  think \n I'm  going  to  go  with  sweet  heat \n barbecue.  Dude,  this  is  like  a  memory \n game.  Okay.  Hot  honey.  It's  hot  honey. \n This  is  the  the  sweet  heat  barbecue.  I'm \n going  to  go  with  sweet  heat.  Oh  my  god. \n I'm  going  to  go  for  one  more.  Sorry.  I \n might  be  here  all  day  just  eating  this. \n Tastes  so \n good.  I'm  going  to  go  with  Hawaiian \n sweet  heat  on  that  one.  Final  answer. \n Another  day,  another  disaster.  Let's  get \n after  it. \n That's  a  pickle.  If  I've  ever  tasted \n one,  I  think  it's  fried  dill  pickle. \n The  dill  pickle \n one.  That's  fried  dill  pickle.  Fried \n dill  pickle  for  sure.  100%.  This  is  my \n favorite  challenge.  This  is  my  favorite \n challenge  for  sure.  Cheddar  sour  cream. \n [Music] \n Oh,  it's  got  some  kick. \n Oh,  dude.  I'm  going  to  go  red  hot.  Red \n hot.  I'm  feeling  very  confident  that \n that  one  is  a  red  hot.  I  The  crab  chip. \n I  don't  What  even  is  the  crab  chip?  The \n crab  chip.  Yeah.  Mike's  hot  honey. \n [Music] \n Now  my  mouth  is  burning.  Maybe  that  was \n red  hot.  I  don't  know  now.  Honey \n barbecue.  I  feel  like  that  last  chip \n just  blasted  my  tongue.  I  got  to  kind  of \n I'm  going to  go  with  sour  cream  and \n onion.  I  don't  remember,  but  it's  the \n first  sour  cream  that  he  said.  Okay.  I'm \n pretty  sure  that  one's  sour  cream  and \n onion.  I'm  going  to  go  with  the  crab \n chip  on  this  one.  I  actually  feel  pretty \n confident  in  this.  It's  It's  been  going \n well.  Regular  sour  cream.  Sour  cream  and \n onion  for  this  one. \n I  actually  feel  pretty  confident  in \n this.  I'm  gonna  go  with  the  crab  chip. \n Salt  vinegar.  Damn  it.  Cheddar's  sour \n cream.  Final  answer. \n That  was  harder  than  I  thought.  And  with \n that,  the  finalists  have  been  decided. \n Sarah  will  compete  against  Patrick  in \n the  final  challenge  for  the  $200,000 \n grand  prize.  But  as  always,  there  will \n be  a  twist.  I'll  be  so  so  happy  if  I  win \n because  it  means  that  I  represented  such \n a  good  cause  and  it  means  that  I  did \n something  good  for  the  world.  I'm  just \n excited.  Every  time  the  challenge \n starts,  she's  quickly  analyzing  and \n she's  trying  to  throw  everyone  else  off. \n Right  now,  don't  pay  attention  to  Sarah \n and  whatever  she  says  and  try  to  beat \n her  in  the  next  challenge.  We're  almost \n there.  Since  I  got  to  win,  I  might  have \n to  screw  someone  over.  This  is  the \n Fastables  decider.  They  are  now  playing \n for  a  massive  $200,000  prize.  No.  There \n are  two  buzzers,  split  and  take.  If  both \n contestants  split,  then  the  money  is \n shared  50/50.  If  one  chooses  split  and \n the  other  chooses  take,  the  splitter \n gets  nothing,  and  the  one  who  chose  take \n gets  it  all.  If  both  press  take,  they \n walk  away  with  nothing.  The  $200,000 \n will  then  be  distributed  between  the \n other  three  contestants. \n What  are  you  thinking  here?  I  don't  I \n don't  know  what  I'm  thinking.  $200,000? \n I  know.  It's  a  lot.  It's  a  lot.  This \n charity  is  kind  of  close.  I  know.  I \n heard  your  story.  Near  and  dear  to  my \n heart.  So,  what  made  me  say  yes  to  doing \n this  challenge  is  because  of  the  charity \n that's  involved  with  it.  My  dad  passed \n away  with  liver  cancer  and  it  was \n horrible  and  I  just  want  to  give  the \n money  towards  something  that  is  near  and \n dear  to  me.  And  I  believe  that,  you \n know,  hopefully  with  the  money  we  could \n help  try  to  prevent  as  many  losses  as  we \n can.  And  um  it's  now  or  never.  It's  just \n so  hard  cuz  it's  like  I  know.  I  know.  I \n I  don't  know  what  you're  going to  pick \n either  though  because  it's  like  a  part \n of  me  thinks  that  you  would  share  it \n with  me  cuz  you  know  how  passionate  I  am \n about  this,  but  a  part  of  me  is  like \n after  hearing  your  story  like  why  would \n you  not  take  it  all?  Right.  I  mean  I  did \n lose  my  dad  to  to  this  horrible  cancer \n and  uh  I  really  want  to  like  help  this \n organization  a \n ton.  I've  made  my  decision.  We  could \n lose  it  all.  Okay. \n [Music] \n I  knew \n you  didn't  think  I  was  going \n to  go.  I'm  so  grateful.  I'm  so  happy  to \n be  involved  in  this  and  was  able  to \n represent  such  a  great  charity.  I'm  so \n It's  still  just  insane  to  me  that  I  was \n able  to  I  was  able  to  win. \n Guys,  we  just  got  $100,000  to  my  choice \n of  charity.  This  is  insane.  This  is  the \n least  I  could  do  to  everybody  that's \n suffering  right  now  with  cancer.  And  um \n it  was  all  for  my  dad,  too.  You  know, \n like  what  an  insane  experience.  I'm  so \n happy  right  now.  We  want  to  take  a \n moment  to  say  thank  you  to  Beast \n Philanthropy  and  everybody  else  that's \n involved  in  this.  We  just  found  out  that \n we  get  another  $100,000  and  instead  of \n us  taking  that  donation,  we  decided  to \n split  it  amongst  all  the  charities \n because  they  all  matter  equally.  So, \n David,  Kenigra,  Rebecca,  come  in  here. \n These  are  for  you  guys.  These  are  for \n you  guys.  For  all  charities, \n this  was  by  far  the  coolest  twist  ever. \n And  to  know  that  they  decided  to  split \n it  between  the  charities  is  something \n that  I  will  never  forget.  I'm  so  happy \n that  as  hard  as  I  lost  out  there, \n nourishing  neighbors  can  still  take  a \n win.  And  I'm  just  so  stoked  to  be  part \n of  this.  I'm  so  thankful  for  Beast \n Philanthropy.  I  am  just \n [Music] \n big  thanks  Beast  Philanthropy. \n This  was  an  amazing  twist.  This  was \n amazing.  Right. \n I  want  to  give  a  special  thanks  to \n Albertson's  for  helping  make  this  video \n possible  as  well  as  some  other  brands \n that  stepped  up  in  a  major  way  like \n Cliff  Bar,  Zoa  Energy,  Halman,  Best \n Foods,  Triscuit,  Sparkling  Ice,  UTS,  and \n Fastables.  Also,  go  check  out  the \n charities  that  the  contestants  were \n competing  for.  All  will  be  linked  in  the \n description.  And  as  always,  shout  out  to \n your  eyeballs  because  by  watching  these \n videos,  you  allow  us  to  do  projects  like",
