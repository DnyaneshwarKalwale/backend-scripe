Congratulations. \n Yes,  the  truth  is  that  with  the \n red  wallet  side  it  was  kind  of  incredible.    You  are \n very  much  liked.   Thank  you. \n [Music] \n Ah. \n [Music] \n What  did  you  say  to  Mikel?   Uh,  I \n told  him  that  when  I  worked  at  Gucci, \n he  was  the  designer,  that's  when  I  started \n to  admire  him,  I  mean,  I  saw  him  and  it's \n like  I'd  seen  a  lifelong  friend  of  mine \n without  even  knowing  him.   It's \n incredible. \n And  well,  the  show  he  put  on  leaves  me \n speechless.   This  was  one  of  the  most \n amazing  things  I've  ever  seen.   And  you  were  with \n the  princess,  the  Mayasa.   Yes,  I  have \n n't  seen  her  for  a  long  time  and  we've  already  arranged \n to  meet  in  Qatar.   Or  if  I  go  back  to \n France,  but  we'll  see  each  other  in  Qatar  in \n November.   G.  Yes,  I  have  the  evil  eye  of  a \n soap  opera.   Yeah,  yeah,  she's  a  bit  mean, \n huh?   Well,  well,  you're  going  to  sit \n next  to  a  real  gamer, \n a  person  playing  video  games,  you're  going  to \n have  next  to  you.   Yo,  look,  I  mean,  how  cute \n you  feel  among  gamers.   How  cool.    I \n love  it. \n [Music] \n Right,  right. \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n Hello.   Finishing  the  day  already. \n Good  night. \n Well,  my  dear  friends,  this  is  it  for  my \n Paris  Fashion  Week.   I  hope  you  enjoyed  it \n as  much  as  I  did.   Have  a  nice  day, \n night  or  evening  and  I'm  off  to  dinner.   He  wants  you  to \n  \n end.   M.",
