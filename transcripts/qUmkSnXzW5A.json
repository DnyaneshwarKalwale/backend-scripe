  "transcript": "over  the  last  3  years  I  built  two \n successful  businesses  from  zero  to \n multiple  six  figures  in  my  20s  made  it \n to  the  top  0.01%  of  my  age  group  could \n featured  on  FS  kjab  and  multiple  other \n Business  Media  outlets  and  grew  my \n personal  brand  to  over  3,000  followers \n online  and  in  the  next  20  minutes  I'm \n going  to  give  you  the  seven  lessons  that \n got  me  there  and  look  this  won't  be  like \n every  single  entrepreneur  giving  you \n vague  advice  about  following  your \n passion  or  just  post  content  because \n quite  frankly  if  you're  watching  this \n you  want  to  get  ahead  of  everyone  else \n as  fast  as  possible  and  honestly  most \n growth  advice  in  the  space  right  now  is \n inapplicable  and  fluffy  especially  when \n you're  building  an  online  business  and  I \n know  this  because  I  used  to  spend  all  of \n my  time  watching  videos  looking  for  an \n answer  and  never  really  getting  anywhere \n this  video  will  help  you  skip  through \n all  of  the  mistakes  and  get  right  to  the \n answers  that  you're  looking  for  now \n firstly  you  need  to  learn  this  blueprint \n content  distri  distribution  and  sales  we \n have  now  shifted  into  an  era  where \n products  aren't  hard  distribution  is \n welcome  to  the  attention  economy \n everyone  can  create  a  new  product \n business  or  service  using  tools  like  AI \n for  free  but  now  people  like  you  and  me \n and  everyone  else  are  fighting  for \n eyballs  because  ultimately  iBall  sell  at \n a  mass  scale  just  creating  content  is  no \n longer  enough  posting  weekly  on  social \n media  is  also  no  longer  enough  having  a \n great  product  is  not  good  enough  either \n because  if  no  one  is  seeing  you  you're \n already  behind  the  smartest  and  most \n successful  entrepreneurs  are  winning  by \n mastering  content  distribution  and \n building  an  audience  of  people  that  love \n them  and  if  you  want  to  do  the  same  the \n easiest  way  to  start  is  by  Distributing \n your  knowledge  this  is  where  the  new \n fortunes  are  being  made  it's  simple  it's \n easy  and  it's  technically  free  your \n first  and  only  task  right  now  as  a \n business  owner  entrepreneur  or  even \n content  creator  looking  to  monetize \n should  be  to  understand  how  to  create \n content  that  generates  Mass  attention \n and  leads  to  distribution  and  ultimately \n more  sales  now  here's  where  lesson \n number  two  comes  in  creating  viral \n educational  content  going  viral  is  so \n cliche  because  everybody  can  go  viral \n today  but  often  it's  full  the  wrong \n reason  on  LinkedIn  I  see  it  all  of  the \n time  crying  CEOs  hotpics  on  holiday  cute \n selfies  10  TED  Talks  that  will  change \n your  life  yeah  they  all  go  viral  but \n they  don't  directly  attribute  towards \n building  leverage  for  your  business  they \n simply  add  to  your  social  status  in  form \n of  followers  or  more  engagement  and  the \n clout  is  great  until  you're  left  with  1 \n million  followers  and  can  only  sell  six \n T-shirts  because  there's  no  real \n incentive  for  your  audience  to  buy \n anything  from  you  now  when  you  go  viral \n with  educational  content  you  hit  the \n jackpot  let  me  explain  educational \n content  solves  a  problem  for  someone  for \n free  you're  proving  your  competence  and \n expertise  to  potential  customers  while \n building  an  audience  who  is  highly \n interested  in  your  unique  perspective \n about  anything  you're  talking  about \n giving  you  Authority  social  proof \n followers  and  social  status  without \n having  to  flex  knowledge  is  power  and \n giving  it  to  someone  for  free  is \n leverage  don't  let  anyone  tell  you  it \n isn't  building  Goodwill  over  time  is \n what  builds  a  true  cult  following  I've \n gone  viral  over  200  times  on  LinkedIn \n about  cracked  on  here  on  YouTube  and \n what  works  is  simple  focus  on  the  first \n 30  seconds  of  your  video  or  the  first \n three  lines  of  your  text  po  here's  a \n copypaste  template  that  you  can  try \n right  now  after  doing  whole  thing  in \n time  frame  here's  how  to  do  decide \n outcome  if  you're  going  through  a  hot \n thing  read  this  chefs  kiss  this  is  the \n ultimate  template  anyone  should  be  using \n right  now  to  grow  and  go  viral  with \n educational  content  look  if  you  create \n educational  content  often  then  you're \n also  building  your  personal  brand  which \n is  lesson  number  three  personal  branding \n is  a  nonnegotiable  it's  the  unspoken \n unfair  advantage  and  it's  not  the  new \n big  thing  because  every  single  person \n who  you  watch  online  to  learn  from  be \n entertained  by  or  inspired  by  have  been \n doing  this  all  behind  the  scenes  my \n personal  brand  has  opened  doors  for  me  I \n didn't  even  know  existed  got  seats  at \n tables  most  people  have  to  pay  to  get \n into  went  from  unemployed  to  being  asked \n to  work  with  the  same  companies  that \n rejected  Me  2  years  ago  just  because  I \n spent  the  last  2  years  building  my \n personal  brand  but  if  you  want  to \n outperform  everyone  else  rushing  to \n build  this  LinkedIn  is  the  number  one \n platform  that  will  help  you  get  ahead \n I'm  all  in  on  this  platform  it's  built \n my  entire  career  from  the  ground  up  and \n what  I  saw  then  when  I  started  back  in \n 2022  is  the  same  thing  I  see  now  a \n massive  disproportion  between  demand  and \n Supply  it  has  1  billion  users  but  only \n 1%  or  even  less  right  now  are  posting \n daily  on  the  platform  and  from  that  1% \n only  a  small  fraction  creates  good \n content  the  opportunity  is  on  top  for \n those  who  are  willing  to  take  the  time \n and  educate  Their  audience  to  the \n highest  level  possible  when  I  started \n building  my  puzzle  run  I  had  two  rules \n one  was  create  outstanding  content  every \n single  week  I  used  a  tool  called  Cleo  to \n hack  my  way  around  it  had  access  to  the \n best  and  most  viral  content  through  it \n and  all  I  needed  was  to  replicate  it  and \n add  my  own  spin  to  the  viral  content  two \n is  racing  the  bar  every  single  post  so  I \n would  use  the  tool  Cleo  to  validate  the \n idea  in  my  head  about  the  post  I  wanted \n to  make  it  will  help  me  find  the \n validated  ideas  so  this  means  finding \n content  that  did  well  in  the  past \n multiple  times  so  I  could  use  it  in  the \n future  and  then  I  would  determine  the \n success  of  the  post  based  on  its \n engagement  and  would  raise  the  bar  after \n to  win  on  linkton  you  need  to  act  like  a \n math  scientist  with  content  and  be \n obsessed  with  it  because  it's  the  only \n way  you're  going  to  get  it  right  and \n quick  it's  the  same  blueprint  we  are  all \n using  to  get  ahead  look  at  the  patteron \n follow  the  clues  success  always  leaves \n them  now  if  you're  like  okay  well  Lara \n but  how  do  I  make  money  with  my  personal \n run  I  don't  know  how  to  sell  I  don't \n know  what  my  offer  is  and  I  don't  have  a \n team  if  you  have  an  Engaged  audience \n everything  else  is  easy  the  only  thing \n you  need  to  do  right  now  is  focus  on \n mastering  one  skill  in  one  topic  while \n everyone  is  telling  you  to  become  the \n niche  you  need  to  win  your  Niche  first \n instead  because  no  one  cares  about  you \n until  you  prove  that  you  can  do \n something  for  them  this  is  simple \n psychology  and  human  bias  at  play  I \n spent  my  first  10  months  in  business \n grinding  creating  content  on  LinkedIn \n and  building  my  freelance  business  which \n then  became  an  agency  created  content \n about  building  a  business  created \n content  about  my  specific  business  and \n how  and  why  my  specific  service  is \n incredibly  beneficial  to  my  ideal  client \n this  is  your  beginers  content  Playbook \n by  the  way  this  creates  momentum  for  you \n because  just  like  going  to  the  gym  on \n January  1st  you  get  used  to  it  it's  low \n friction  and  it's  free  then  as  I \n progressed  and  got  clients  I  began  to \n write  for  them  at  scale  which  added  the \n volume  I  needed  for  both  writing  content \n and  business  I  wasn't  an  expert  at \n writing  or  my  Niche  but  I  became  an \n expert  by  brute  forced  just  by \n repetition  every  single  week  one  thing \n and  the  only  thing  that  stuck  with  me \n from  my  door  to-do  sales  days  was  this \n quote  hard  work  beats  Talent  every \n single  time  and  this  can  apply  for  you \n outside  the  writing  and  sales  or  even \n coaching  space  look  if  you're  an  agency \n owner  and  you're  writing  about  hacks \n tips  lessons  case  studies  every  single \n day  and  every  single  week  on  and  on \n you'll  start  Gathering  more  knowledge \n and  memorizing  it  which  then  makes  you \n better  when  executing  for  clients  and \n this  also  makes  you  top  of  mind  for  your \n current  and  past  and  future  clients  as \n well  and  puts  you  in  the  perfect \n position  to  grow  and  after  that  you \n stack  skills  on  top  of  that  Master \n writing  then  Master  sales  then  master \n storytelling  then  Master  distribution \n and  so  on  become  a  full  star  Creator  or \n entrepreneur  this  makes  you  the  only \n choice  now  besides  that  to  get  dream \n clients  fast  you  can  use  lesson  number \n five  solve  a  problem  for  free  and  charge \n for  the  execution  this  is  a  proven  and \n tested  way  every  single  successful \n friend  that  I  have  in  the  space  has  used \n to  gain  their  first  clients  or  their \n dream  clients  I  know  this  because  I've \n done  it  myself  and  I've  had  it  done  on \n me  and  it's  easy  to  do  we  all  have  a \n list  of  clients  we  dream  to  work  with \n all  are  willing  to  work  with  at  the \n start  now  they  also  have  a  problem  that \n you  know  you  can't  fix  maybe  you  think \n they're  leaving  money  on  the  table  maybe \n you  think  that  you  can  grow  Their \n audience  maybe  you  think  that  their \n email  suck  whatever  you  know  you  can  do \n for  someone  that  they're  not  doing  that \n is  your  pitch  or  in  my  opinion  you're  in \n the  key  here  is  that  you  do  not  try  and \n sell  them  on  this  you  give  it  to  them \n for  or  free  but  the  delivery  has  to  be \n precise  and  well  executed  for  this  you \n take  a  mega  personalized  approach  you \n find  a  problem  for  them  you  then  go \n ahead  and  solve  it  without  them  knowing \n and  then  you  deliver  them  the  final \n product  it  can  be  a  loom  video  an  actual \n resource  you  can  use  or  a  PDF  but  it \n needs  to  be  tangible  and  immediately \n useful  here  you're  leading  with  value \n and  you're  being  useful  this  is  the \n first  impression  you  will  leave  them \n with  and  they  count  a  video  freelancer \n contacted  me  a  year  ago  and  here's \n exactly  what  he  said  hey  Queen  I  made \n this  video  for  you  here's  a  file  so  you \n can  post  it  and  here's  the  thumbnail  no \n ask  no  price  just  value  add  today  that \n St  person  is  my  main  editor  for  this \n YouTube  video  you're  watching  right  now \n remember  this  being  an  asset  is \n extremely  underrated  always  find  a  way \n to  be  useful  to  people  not  just  another \n bill  to  pay  now  this  is  slightly \n controversial  and  it  goes  against  a  lot \n of  common  advice  but  lesson  number  six \n is  that  you  need  to  work  smart  and  hard \n I  personally  think  that  the  idea  of \n working  smart  and  not  hard  is  stupid \n especially  when  you're  building  a \n business  from  zero  or  even  when  you're \n trying  to  gain  some  traction  again \n everybody  is  so  busy  automating  using  AI \n delegating  and  systematizing  in  order  to \n work  smart  but  then  they  spend  all  of \n this  time  focusing  on  the  wrong  things \n because  no  AI  tool  will  substitute  your \n inability  to  do  something  well  I  see \n this  all  the  time  and  I've  experienced \n it  myself  but  you  lose  more  time \n building  a  fancy  notion  document  or  an \n automated  email  sequence  that  will  fail \n because  you  haven't  successfully  tested \n it  manually  and  you  will  lose  money  and \n time  hiring  new  members  for  tasks  that \n you  haven't  fully  understood  so  this \n Moto  of  work  smart  not  hard  turned  into \n easy  peasy  lemon  squeezy  to  like \n difficult  difficult  lemon  difficult  for \n me  I  tried  to  hire  for  different  roles \n and  failed  because  I  didn't  need  to  hire \n yet  I  tried  automating  emails  and \n content  but  failed  because  I  didn't  need \n to  do  it  but  I  did  it  because  all  of \n these  millionaires  online  are  telling  me \n to  delegate  optimize  and  hire  but  if  you \n learn  something  from  me  Let  It  Be  this  a \n successful  business  doesn't  have  to  be  a \n big  business  with  multiple  employees \n slack  sappier  automations  everywhere  Ai \n chatbots  and  all  of  these  things  a \n successful  business  is  one  that  Master \n just  one  thing  one  product  one  service \n and  one  offer  that  can  then  be \n multiplied  onto  various  different  mini \n assets  I.E  agency  owners  start  with  an \n agency  service  they  Master  resource  and \n are  able  to  duplicate  them  then  they  can \n start  one  to  many  distribution  in  forms \n of  Consulting  and  corporate  workshops \n and  even  events  and  ultimately \n then  they  can  productize  their  service \n via  a  course  a  book  a  PDF  YouTube \n content  and  so  on  right  now  I  only  have \n like  two  full-time  people  on  my  team \n everyone  else  is  either  an  agency  or  a \n consultant  and  if  I  buil  an  agency  again \n it  would  be  around  five  people  Max  to \n scale  to  maybe  50k  to  100K  lesson  number \n seven  is  probably  the  most  useful  one \n Beyond  nailing  marketing  distribution \n and  even  client  acquisition  this  is \n where  you  get  the  chance  to  create  your \n own  lock  and  it  starts  by  putting \n yourself  in  the  right  place  at  the  right \n time  networking  you  see  I  love  LinkedIn \n not  just  because  he  had  an  extreme \n unders  saturation  of  good  content  but \n because  he  had  access  to  the  wealthiest \n Network  I  could  ever  dream  of  I  was \n always  one  to  two  connections  away  from \n my  dream  CEOs  Founders  millionair  and \n mentors  and  on  top  of  all  of  that  you \n can  also  get  access  to  networking  events \n you  couldn't  find  anywhere  else  they're \n usually  invite  only  or  only  marketed \n within  the  small  networks  that  you'll \n find  on  LinkedIn  so  by  simply  being  on \n the  platform  you're  already  ahead \n because  you  get  F  dips  at  all  of  these \n opportunities  now  showing  up  isn't \n enough  but  if  you  show  up  having  done \n everything  I  mentioned  from  lesson \n number  one  to  lesson  number  six  then \n you're  off  to  a  better  start  than  most \n you  build  some  presence  potentially  some \n social  proof  and  are  already  liked  and \n trusted  by  some  people  which  gives  you \n more  leverage  when  starting  a \n conversation  or  following  up  with \n someone  you  met  at  these  events  you  get \n to  stand  out  amongst  all  the  people  in \n these  events  because  you  are  an  asset \n not  just  another  attendee  see  at  the \n start  of  my  business  journey  I  went  to \n every  networking  opportunity  I  could  get \n my  hands  on  it  was  my  way  of  building  my \n own  momentum  I  was  showing  up  meeting \n people  connecting  with  them  and  then  I \n went  to  LinkedIn  and  created  content \n about  the  event  and  what  I  learned \n pushing  my  personal  run  even  more \n because  of  the  halo  effect  that  came \n with  being  in  proximity  with  many  of  the \n other  attendees  and  all  these  speakers \n and  resulting  in  more  attention  coming \n my  way  and  like  I  mentioned  attention \n and  audience  are  the  ultimate  forms  of \n Leverage  learn  to  build  it  the  right  way \n and  there  is  not  a  single  chance  you \n will  lose  my  journey  is  living  proof  of \n this  and  if  you  want  to  learn  the  full \n personal  branding  blueprint  for  you  to \n get  a  head  start  then  watch  this  video \n on  how  to  blow  up  your  LinkedIn  as  fast \n as  possible  see  you  on  the  next  one",
