  "transcript": "[Music] \n I  actually  feel  like  I'm  getting  married \n I  look  at  this  custom  dress  wow \n [Music] \n it's  actually  kind  of  cute  I  actually \n really  like  it  it's  hard  to  beat  the \n pink  one  but  it's  not \n [Music] \n bad  I  like  it  but  shows  a  lot  she  said \n this  is  a  $5,000  verace  dress  it  was  the \n last  one  too  and  her  bank  called  her  cuz \n they're  like  did  you  buy  this \n [Music] \n oh  you're  Telly  grumbling  I  know  do  you \n want  to  eat  oh  that's  that's  your  darl \n you  should  pan  yourself  cuz  he's  fitting \n too  it's  a  good  time  to  like  dress  up  I \n know  some  my  friends  are  like  I  don't \n know  if  I  want  to  go  like  I  don't  know \n what's  the  point  I'm  like  dressing  up  is \n the  point  having  a  reason  to  just  go  all \n out  that's  the  point  when  do  streamers \n really  get  to  do  that  you \n [Music] \n know  this  is  your  first  time  hosting  the \n show  right  how  do  you  feel  about  that \n initially  I  was  a  bit  nervous  to  say  yes \n so  it  took  me  like  a  month  to  say  yes \n but  leading  up  to  it  I'm  just  like  it's \n actually  okay  all  I  need  to  do  frankly \n is  make  sure  the  physical  aspect  is  set \n up  which  Kendy  my  stylist  took  care  of \n entirely  really  and  you  know  have  these \n two  on  Glam  and  then  the  only  other \n thing  I  need  to  do  is  be  literate  I  just \n need  to  read  the \n teleprompter  and  I  think  I  can  do  that \n maybe  one  of  the  reasons  I'm  less \n nervous  is  cuz  I  presented  an  award  last \n year  I  felt  really  comfortable  because  I \n knew  everybody  I  was  talking  too  it \n wasn't  that  nerve-wracking  actually  to \n me  it's  like  if  I  mess  up  on  stage  we'll \n just  turn  it  into  a  bit  everything  is \n content  when  you're  a  streamer  so  I'm \n not  too  nervous  but  fingers  crossed  you \n know  fingers  crossed  you  got  this  thank \n you  yeah  she  got  this  I  was  telling  them \n this  looks  like  the  kind  of  hair  a  queen \n in  a  video  game  would  have  or  like  Game \n of  Thrones  it's  like  Game  of  Thrones \n hair  hi  I'm  a  hair  stus  you  have  a  name \n my  name  is  youi  you're  so  cute  someday \n he's  going  to  have  his  own  brand  he  in \n the  work  yes  my  brand  is  coming  up  hi \n I'm  a  Yuki  makeup \n artist  okay  should  I  doy  Yuki  Yuki  hi \n I'm  Yuki  makeup \n artist  stop  I  can't  she  said \n Sor  interrupting  the  Vlog  for  a  very \n suitable  ad  break  streamer  Awards  you \n know  I've  been  a  streamer  for  so  many \n years  and  one  of  the  questions  I  get \n asked  the  absolute  most  is  how  haven't \n you  gone  crazy  yet  and  the  honest  truth \n is  I  have  gone  crazy  but  every  time  the \n one  thing  that  has  brought  me  back \n without  fail  has  been  therapy  and  one  of \n the  easiest  ways  to  get  started  with \n therapy  is  with  the  use  of  today's \n sponsor  Better  Health  with  the  New  Year \n having  just

 want  to  avoid  burnout \n this  year  please  and  three  I  want  to \n make  sure  that  I'm  moving  my  body \n regularly  even  while  I'm  stressed  I \n think  that's  the  habit  I  let  go
