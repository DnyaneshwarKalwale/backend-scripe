just  kept  staring  at  you  and  then \n I  was  like  you're  so  beautiful  I  just \n kind  of  R  away  that's  so  sweet  thank  you \n so  much  an  honor  to \n meet  so \n [Music] \n cute

\n God  I'm  a  fan  cuz  of  them  that's  so \n sweet  thank  you  I  can't  avoid  watching \n you  when  they're  watching  you  guys  so \n much  that's  really  sweet  thank \n you  Jamie  and  I  are  having  the  craziest \n gossip  session  we  hit  away  from  everyone \n even  know  don't  want  to  know  don't  even \n know  this  [ __ ]  is  not  safe  for  twitch \n Reddit  X  nothing  I  just  got  to  say  we're \n both  doing  it  for  the \n plot  hello  beautiful  people  today  I'm \n going  to  take  you  through  my  current \n workout  routine  as  of  late  sometimes  I \n either  go  to  my  building  gym  alone  which \n oh  my  God  it's  so  nice  to  have  a  gym  in \n your  building  or  I  sometimes  do  a \n private  training  session  as  you  guys  saw \n in  the  last  Vlog  or  sometimes  I  just \n like  to  watch  a  little  YouTube  video \n follow  along  yoga  Pilates  whatever  I've \n actually  this  week  started  um  a  30-day \n yoga  challenge  and  I  could  not  recommend \n it  more  it's  why  this  girl  on  YouTube \n Adriana  Adrian  she's  so  good  and  you \n know  how  yoga  can  be  like  hard  as  [ __ ] \n sometimes  and  kind  of  not  fun  she  makes \n it  just  the  perfect  amount  of  like  chill \n and  just  a  little  bit  challenging  like \n you  actually  feel  like  you're \n progressing  to  the  point  that  I  feel \n like  I  could  actually  do  the  whole \n 30-day  challenge  I  did  not  think  that  I \n could  so  I  super  duper  recommend  that  so \n basically  along  side  doing  this  30-day \n challenge  I  still  feel  just  fine  to  like \n go  exercise  and  workout  it  feels  like \n more  of  a  flexibility  full  body \n challenge  as  oppos  to  like  girl  I'm \n [ __ ]  dying  let  me  show  you  guys  my \n gym  routine  right  now \n [Music] \n [Music] \n you  know  when  you  do  a  set  and  then  your \n head \n hurts  I'm  dizzy  bro \n [Music] \n okay  I'm  done  the  workout  that  I  would \n usually  do  at  the  gym  on  my  own  but \n since  I'm  here  anyways  I'm  going  to  do \n the  next  day  of  the  30-day  yoga \n challenge  and  then  usually  I  might  go  on \n the  treadmill  or  stair  Master  just  do \n some  sort  of  like  5  minute  cardio  to \n flush  things  out  I  think  I  might  just  go \n for  a  walk  I'll  do  the  yoga  little  walk \n and  I'm  done \n genuinely  my  favorite  thing  to  do  after \n a  gym  session  is  to  eat  also  sorry  my \n hair  looks  literally  cookie  beans  I'm \n having  some  jerk  chicken  seriously  this \n chicken  is  so  freaking  mean  some \n cauliflower  rice  and  spinach  as  well  as \n halib  boot  Ceviche  with  grain  F  chips \n it's  like  a  snack  and  a  snack  and  of \n course  my  beloved  sriracha  like  it's \n just  going  to  be  better  with \n Sriracha  I  didn't  make  the  rules  I  just \n follow \n them  I  don't  know  what  a  saiche  is  but \n that's \n fire  oh  my  God  I  really  wanted  to  talk \n to  you  guys  but  this  is  just  so  good  so \n let  me  give  you  guys  some  work  tea  for \n the  last  few  months  things  within  my \n team  have  been  shifting  maybe  some \n people  got  fired  and  maybe  some  people \n got  hired \n I  worked  with  the  same  agent  literally \n she's  like  a  sister  to  me  I  worked  with \n her  for  like  five  or  six  years  like  I \n love  her  so  much  but  unfortunately  she \n retired  so  I  started  working  with  a  new \n agent  like  6  to  8  months  ago  something \n like  that  he's  really  nice  I  like  them \n but  it's  still  like  a  new  working \n relationship  and  then  I  also  brought  on \n a  new  manager  and  started  working  closer \n with  my  lawyer  not  for  reasons  that  I \n want  not  cuz  he's  a  bad  guy  you  want \n your  lawyer  to  do  their  job  you  don't \n want  to  have  to  talk  to  them  you  know \n what  I  mean  inserting  this  to  clarify \n that  what  I  meant  is  if  you're  talking \n to  your  lawyer  a  lot  it's  probably  cuz \n you're  in  the  middle  of  some  kind  of \n legal  issues  whereas  if  you  don't  hear \n from  your  lawyer  for  a  while  it  probably \n means  there  are  no  big  problems  going  on \n which  would  be  good  anyways  something \n happened  recently  I  can't  give  you  guys \n too  many  details  legally  it  resulted  in \n like  literally  all  three  of  those  people \n my  agent  my  manager  my  lawyer  all  kind \n of  pointing  fingers  at  each  other  and  me \n in  the  middle  watching  these  like  grown \n men  just  point  fingers  at  each  other \n it's  kind  of  like  when  you're  a  kid  and \n your  parents  are  fighting  and  then  you \n feel  like  you  have  to  be  the  adult  and  I \n mean  like  I  am  an  adult  but  I'm  also  the \n client  in  this  situation  and  so  I  felt \n like  I  had  to  manage  these  people  and \n these  relations  which  isn't  a  bad  thing \n like  sometimes  you  just  have  to  do  that \n when  you're  a  part  of  a  team  but  it  just \n feels  kind  of  weird  sometimes  when  these \n people  are  like  all  guys  that  are  10  or \n 20  years  older  than  you  and  you're  like \n this  little  freaking  5'4  girl  being \n like  and  Loki  I  think  they're  kind  of \n scared  of  me  which  is  funny  ultimately \n it's  just  been  a  really  new  experience \n and  challenge  for  me  to  be  in  a  new  team \n of  people  and  try  to  make  sure  everyone \n communicates  effectively  and  gets  along \n well  it's  been  trouble  in  Paradise  I'm \n still  kind  of  trying  to  see  things \n through  give  everyone  a  chance  before  I \n decide  who  do  I  want  to  work  with  super \n longterm  and  who  do  I  maybe  not  want  to \n work  with  longterm  Bose  bring  me  his  toy \n he's  like  please  play  with  me  please \n that's  my  work  to  as  a  blate  praying \n everything  gets  resolved  SL \n [Music] \n [Music] \n smoothie  cuz  my  tummy  hurts  but  only \n halfway  because  uh  don't  want  to  be  too \n full  to  you  want  to  say  hi  to  the  Vlog \n this  is \n Frank  all  right  so  when  I  come  into  the \n gym  what's  the  plan  so  generally  when \n when  anyone  comes  in  we  work  on \n something  that's  more  full  body  a  little \n more  holistic  like  to  balance  all  the \n posture  my  gamer  posture  better  posture \n a  little  bit  more  lower  body  focus  so  we \n can  achieve  the  aesthetic  that  we're \n looking  for  a  big  fat  ass  sure  make  sure \n she  stays  healthy  first  and  foremost \n Health  First  aesthetic  seconds \n [Music] \n [Music] \n s  1 \n [Music] \n 2 \n [Music] \n up  and \n hello  post  gym  I'm  eating  my  other \n cameras  are  dead  so  I'm  using  my  phone \n but  I  just  wanted  to  chat  with  you  guys \n give  you  a  little  dating  life  update \n kind  of  thing  I  know  last  video  I  talked \n about  my  breakup  in  reality  my  breakup \n happened  like  a  few  months  ago  I  just \n like  to  give  myself  time  to  process \n things  before  I  ever  talk  about  them \n publicly  I  don't  know  I  feel  like \n breakups  can  differ  so  much  I  think \n typically  people  feel  like  it  needs  to \n be  like  this  really  big  life  event  in \n some  ways  it  really  is  and  it's  an \n important  thing  to  like  properly  process \n but  also  I  think  sometimes  you  can  take \n a  step  back  and  just  be  grateful  that \n that  person  was  in  your  life  or  however \n long  it  was  and  understand  that  there's \n going  to  be  so  many  chapters  in  your \n life  you  know  some  days  it's  like  you're \n totally  fine  it  comes  in  waves  some  days \n something  random  can  remind  you  of  it  it \n makes  you  realize  you  have  more  things \n to  process  but  luckily  by  the  time  you \n guys  see  this  you  know  it'll  have  been  a \n fair  amount  of  time  time  that  I've  been \n processing  certain  things  and  to  be \n honest  I  feel  like  the  time  alone  has \n been  so  good  for  me  like  it's  made  me \n realize  when  you're  single  there's  no \n one  else  to  blame  for  anything \n everything  you  like  or  don't  like  about \n your  life  you  kind  of  just  have  to  take \n responsibility  for  cuz  you're  not  really \n sacrificing  anything  for  anyone  else  so \n that's  been  a  really  good  kind  of  wakeup \n call  or \n realization  sorry  I  really  am  so  hungry \n another  thing  I  realized  is  that  at  this \n stage  in  my  life  I  thought  oh  maybe  I'll \n have  to  go  back  and  date  a  bunch  and \n find  someone  new  blah  blah  blah  but  I \n actually  realized  I  know  what  I  want \n like  I'm  actually  picky  as  hell  in  a \n good  way  throughout  the  years  the  more \n experience  you  get  the  more  you  kind  of \n hone  in  on  what  you  want  and  need  I  was \n talking  to  my  therapist  about  this \n having  a  family  and  getting  married  and \n having  kids  and  all  of  these  things \n they've  been  goals  of  mine  my  whole  life \n and  I  try  not  to  be  too  strict  with  the \n goal  like  sure  it's  something  that  I \n want  but  I  can  be  accepting  if  it's  not \n in  the  cards  for  me  anyways  other  random \n little  update  that  kind  of  pisses  me  off \n but  that  I  think  might  be  funny  to  share \n living  in  La  like  I  really  don't  meet \n that  many  new  people  people  kind  of  keep \n to  themselves  or  like  to  their  friend \n groups  even  when  you  go  to  like  parties \n or  events  or  whatever  people  are  not \n that  friendly  unless  they  know  they  can \n benefit  from  you  but  that's  a  story  for \n another  day  so  frankly  one  of  the  best \n ways  to  date  is  dating  apps  but  in  the \n past  when  I've  tried  to  use  dating  apps \n everybody  reports  me  cuz  they  think  I'm \n catfishing \n myself  so  there's  this  dating  app  called \n Rya  and  the  whole  premise  of  Rya  is  that \n you  have  to  apply  and  it's  supposed  to \n be  like  a  really  exclusive  dating  app \n with  celebrities  and  so  you  have  to  be \n accepted  into  the  app  which  can  I  just \n say  respectfully  I  think  is  so  cringe \n like  I  think  the  premise  is  so  cringe \n but  is  it  also  potentially  my  best  shot \n at  meeting  someone  half  decent  kind  of \n kind  of  two  3  months  ago  I  applied  and \n they  finally  they  took  2  months  to \n respond  to  my  application  so  I  go  on  the \n app  and  they're  like  we  have  an  answer \n for  you  I'm  like  oh  let's  [ __ ]  go  I \n click  the  next  button  and  it  goes  you've \n been  wait  listed  we  check  our  wait  list \n often  and  we'll  give  you  an  update \n soon  I  said  [ __ ]  what  do  you  mean  and \n I'm  not  even  saying  this  like  oh  I'm  so \n fine  you  better  accept  me  I'm  so  fine \n and  famous  you  better  accept  me  no  but \n it's  like  I'm  shocked  you  made  me  wait  2 \n months  just  to  waight  list  me  and  you \n know  what  maybe  I'm  not  that  fine  and \n famous  but  like  I'm  pretty  C  like  I'm \n not  bad  so  now  I'm  kind  of  mad  and  now \n out  of  sheer  pettiness  I  don't  want  to \n [ __ ]  use  it  you  didn't  want  me  I \n don't  want  you  you  know  what  I  mean \n anyways  I  might  just  be  throwing  that \n out  the \n window  anyways  that's  my  little  update \n I'm  not  too  pressed  about  things  I'm \n happy  with  the  progress  that  I've  made \n really  focusing  on  myself  it's  been  a \n good  life  reset  mental  reset  I  still \n care  so  much  frankly  for  anyone  that \n I've  ever  been  involved  with  so  it's \n nice  to  keep  those  positive  relations \n make  sure  everything's  good  and  still \n looking  forward  to  the  future  I  will \n keep  you  guys  updated  bye  hello  don't \n mind  the  makeup  I'm  getting  ready  to  go \n to  a  party  and  I  don't  usually  go  to \n parties  come  get  ready  with  me  and  I \n will  try  to  take  you  guys  along  with  me \n I'm  watching  this  YouTube  right  I  really \n like  her  name  is  Kenny  JD  she  basically \n does  summaries  and  reviews  of  a  really \n strange  and  obscure  and  often  really \n shitty  movies  but  she  makes  it  so \n entertaining  and  for  some  reason  it's \n really  satisfying  to  watch  a  summary  of \n something  that's  really  long  but  in  a \n shorter  form  video  I  love  that  kind  of \n content  anyways  let's  get  ready  I'll \n show  you  guys  what  I'm  wearing  and  we'll \n go  see  how  the  party  is  she  used  to  be \n before  she  dated  Dallas  again  they  were \n high  school \n sweetheart  the  beginning \n [Music] \n here  is  my  little  oot  TD  sorry  the \n lighting  is  not  the  best  the  dress  is \n from  acne  Studios  the  boots  are  diesel \n the  back  is  diesel  the  Bolero  is  from  I \n literally  do  not  know  where  this \n butterfly  is  from  Fred  seagull  the  gold \n one  I've  been  trying  to  find  where  it's \n from  I  think  it's  from  Anna  Louisa  but  I \n couldn't  find  the  link  I  couldn't  pick \n which  dress  to  wear  so  I  asked  you  guys \n on  the  IG  broadcast  channel  and  this  is \n the  one  you  chose  I  think  good  pick \n thank \n you  hello  it's  so  loud  we've  done  photos \n we  said  hi  to  everyone  I'm \n done  I'm  back  home  it's  1:30  a.m.  I'm \n exhausted  I've  pieced  together  why  I \n don't  really  like  partying  let  me \n explain  I  feel  like  oh  my  God  sorry  I \n ate  so  much  food  at  snd  I'm  so  full  okay \n so  here's  why  I  don't  really  like \n partying  basically  if  I  go  to  a  party  or \n a  function  it's  so  hit  or  miss  it  could \n be  a  9  or  10  out  of  10  like  I  could  have \n an  amazing  time  make  new  friends  run \n around  socializing  with  people  just \n really  feel  like  it's  so  worth  it  but \n honestly  70%  of  the  time  it's  like  a  5 \n out  of  10  you  go  you're  happy  to  say  hi \n to  a  couple  people  and  then  you're  just \n like  I  don't  really  like  [ __ ]  with \n nobody  here  like  I'm  not  really  in  the \n mood  to  talk  to  anyone  you  know  it's \n just  like  so  inconsistent  10  to  20%  of \n the  time  it's  going  to  be  incredible  a \n bit  of  the  time  it'll  be  mid  and  some  of \n the  times  it  might  even  [ __ ]  be \n bad  however  if  I  play  video  games  or  I \n partake  in  a  hobby  that  I  like  I  watch  a \n TV  show  that  I  like  I  read  a  book  that  I \n like  if  I  do  one  of  those  kinds  of \n hobbies  instead  of  going  to  a  party  oh  I \n know  I'm  having  I'm  not  even  drunk  by \n the  way  if  you  guys  think  I'm  drunk  I \n haven't  had  a  single  [ __ ]  drink  I \n think  sometimes  when  you're  around  a  lot \n of  drunk  people  you  start  talking  kind \n of  drunk  though  back  to  my  point  if  I'm \n partaking  in  one  of  those  Hobbies  I  know \n I'm  going  to  have  a  good  time  no  doubt \n about  it  7  8  9  10  out  of  10  it's  going \n to  be  a  good  time  I  go  to  a  party  bro \n I'm  rolling  a  dice  and  it's  waited  to  be \n shitty  so  that's  how  I  view  it  and  how  I \n kind  of  view  going  out  and  maybe  this  is \n stupid  but  I'm  happy  living  my  stupid \n little  life  okay \n [Music]",
