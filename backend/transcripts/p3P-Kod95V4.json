  "transcript": "all  right  so  this  is  Alex  and  this  is \n Alex's  very  messy  desk  so  what  we \n decided  to  do  is  give  four  of  our \n designers  500  bucks  each  to  design  Alex \n a  much  nicer  cleaner  looking  set  very \n functional  that  anyone  can \n build  and  then  Alex  you're  going  to  pick \n a  winner  and  then  you're  going  to  switch \n to  that  one \n permanently  I  don't  want  to  switch  my \n Des  I  like \n it  hey  everyone  I  don't  I  don't  I  what \n I'm  going  doing  with  my  hand  here  some \n kind  of  anime  thing  or  something  what's \n up  everyone  I'm  Tim  I  the  graphic \n designer  here  at  the  channel  I've  seen \n Alex's  desk  I  know  what  he  does  here  at \n the  studio  but  the  biggest  thing  that  I \n had  in  mind  was  trying  to  build  a  desk \n that  I  thought  was  accessible  to  other \n people  that  are  watching  this  video \n specifically  like  that's  really  who  I \n was  I  had  in  mind  we  have  a  white  desk \n right  now  let's  get  a  little  bit  of \n color  on  there  yeah  it's  kind  of  like  a \n faux  leather  but  I  wanted  to  go  for \n something  because  Alex  is  a  NYX  fan  and \n Al  basketball  so  something  in  that  realm \n all  right  so  we've  got  you  know  a  nice \n Swatch  of  color  the  biggest  thing  I \n noticed  with  Alex's  desk  right  now  is \n there's  a  lot  of  gray  and  white  and  and \n like  black  so  it's  just  very  muddy  tones \n so  the  idea  here  is  a  just  make  it  more \n accessible  but  like  the  color  can  help \n like  delineate  and  kind  of  like  you  know \n set  aside  spaces  this  looks  familiar \n I've  stolen  this  from  your  desk  at  least \n a  half  dozen  times  this  month  yes  these \n are  great  this  is  like  12  bucks  it's \n just  nice  for  like  if  you're  ever \n cutting  stuff  on  your  desk  like  I  don't \n know  how  often  people  do  that  but  it's \n just  nice  to  have  like  a  space  for  that \n so  this  is  my  favorite  piece  this  is \n something  I  definitely  recommend  for  a \n monitor  rizer  like  I  think  this  was  this \n was  like  60  bucks  I  haven't  had  any \n issues  with  it  it  comes  in  different \n colors  but  it  came  with  a  snack  no  that \n was  silica  for  me  to  eat  I'm  glad  I \n wiped  that  away  so  nice  just  bent  bamboo \n and  it's  got  these  little  pads  so  it \n won't  you  know \n skate  around  like  look  at  that  ruler \n again  cutting  stuff  all  right  no  snack \n this  is  something  that  he  can  use  it's  a \n modular  wood  again  some  of  these  aren't \n like  the  most  quality  pieces  ever  but \n this  one  is  like  pretty  good  for  what  I \n found  on  Amazon  I  think  again  it  was \n like  20  or  $30  like  do \n this  all  right  other  pieces  so  MX  Master \n these  are  super  popular  I  think  my  dad \n loves  it  my  brother  has  one  everyone  at \n the  office  has  one  of  these  here  it's \n also  my  favorite  so  yeah  works  out  MX \n mechanical  mini  These  are  nice  too  cuz \n the  battery  lasts  like  I  think  like  3 \n months  on  a  charge  or  something  like  it \n lasts  pretty  well  and  it's  got  a  a  great \n sound  mhm  clamp  so \n $2  it's  a  uh  it's  a  fidget  thing  it's  a \n noise  maker  and  a  clamp  yeah  if  you  want \n to \n anun  um  this  is  like  a  $2  clamp  again \n for  headphones  these  are  the  uh  at  m50s \n um  they're  great  I  mean  they've  been \n around \n forever  and  you  kind  of  can't  beat  the \n quality  for  the  price  they're \n [Music] \n at  I  think  minimalism  gets  like  a  bad \n rep  because  it's  just  like  you  can't \n have  anything  that  you  enjoy  ever  like \n if  he  wants  to  put  more  of  like  I  know \n he  has  a  lot  of  decorative  pieces  like \n you  can  still  do  that  like  it  still  has \n the  ability  to  do  all  of  those  things \n like  it  doesn't  have  to  be  void  of  your \n personality  or  void  of  like  interest  I \n think  that  it's  you  know  very \n aesthetically  pleasing  beautiful  but \n also  sort  of \n utilitarian  I  don't  I  couldn't  get  a \n good  read  on  what  he  thought  of  the  desk \n I'd  say  like  a  B  minus  if  you  were  going \n to  give  me  a  grade  on  it  who  are  you \n betting  on  to  to  win  man  I  went  to \n design  school  with  Michael  for  five \n years  so  like  I  just  know  he's  always \n got  the  ace  up  his  sleeve  Marquez  what \n does  your  Des  setup  look  like  oh  pretty \n clean  I  think  uh  it's  all  on  Mac  Pro  M2 \n Ultra  and  then  I  have  a  mouse  pad  right \n here  actually  for  like  daily  drivers  and \n phones  I'm  testing  Yamaha  hs8s  for  audio \n had  those  forever  Pro  display  XDS  for \n video  had  those  forever  uh  I've  got  a \n webcam  up  here  I  also  have  a  belon \n wireless  charger  cuz  I  forget  to  charge \n stuff  uh  Apollo  twin  is  my  audio  device \n and  hd650s  to  edit  and  listen  to  stuff \n and  then  mouse  and  keyboard  so  keyron \n key1  one  and  a  wireless  trackpad  and \n then  my  Logitech  mouse  for  specifically \n subscribing  to  the  studio  Channel  nice \n little  animation  there  I  would  describe \n his  desk  as  a  storage  closet  I  think \n very  highly  of  me  clearly  first  is  your \n desk  mat  okay  right  here  this  is  the \n deskmat  from  oier  matte  black  I  think \n it's  actually  on  sale  right  now  on  his \n website  so  this  was  uh  well  within \n budget  you'll  see  I'm  going  for  like  a \n colorful  like  monochrome  but  colorful \n situation  for  your  deck  those  are  those \n are  oxymoronic  that  doesn't  yeah  you'll \n see  where  on  okay  you'll  see  the  vision \n you'll  see  the  vision  this  is  your \n storage  okay  so  when  they  told  me  the \n budget  my  initial  reaction  was \n immediately  Ikea  right  over  there  okay \n this  is  why  okay  so  these  are  the  scus \n boards  are  skus  I  don't  know  how  to \n pronounce  it  but  they're  from  Ikea  you \n know  the  peg  boards  that  they  sell  these \n clip  into  those  but  because  you  don't \n have  a  pegboard  you  have  an  Omar  okay \n you  can  put  all  your  knickknacks  your  go \n do  hickeys  your  goads  all  of  your  little \n like  Pokemon  things  they  can  all  stay \n right  there  and  you  have  easy  access \n that  sounds  messy  all  right  more  storage \n okay  I  like  this  is  more  for  your  tools \n and  stuff  that  you  kind  of  just  have \n around  because  you  need  quick  access  to \n things  you  got  to  be  able  to  see  them \n this  is  also  from  Ikea  and  I  think  it \n works  best  right  under  here  see  I'm \n seeing  the  break  more  storage  okay \n storage  you're  sensing  a  theme  here  but \n with  this  one  you  could  see  into \n everything  okay  then  the  keyboard  okay \n so  you  have  a  very  nice  mechanical \n keyboard  right  now  well  out  of \n budget  welcome  to  my  world  this  is  the \n newy  75  it's  my  personal  keyboard  I  love \n this  thing  okay  so  if  I  choose  yours \n you're  giving  me  your  personal  keyboard \n yeah  you  will  have  this  for  the \n remainder  of  this  video  and  then  I  take \n it  back  and  you  won't  have  it  anymore \n then  I  won't  have  it  anymore  until  I \n take  it  back  and  you  won't  have  anymore \n ever  and  then  it'll  be  yours  until  I \n take  I  get  to  steal  from  you  and  then \n you  can  steal  it  until  I  take  it \n back  this  is  the  Logitech  vertical  Mouse \n okay  now  I  have  not  used  this  but  the \n cameraman  Rich  swears  by  this  and  I \n messaged  him  on  slack  to  ask  him  his \n opinion  of  these  and  he  gave  me  like  a \n full  paragraph  speaking  very  highly  of \n it  okay  it's  good  because  you  can  put  it \n like  this  and  then  you're  meant  to  be \n like  standing  kind  of  like  this  we're \n not  really  supposed  to  be  at  our  desk \n typing  away  like  this  so  if  you're  just \n browsing  doing  things  you  can  just  keep \n your  hand  in  a  normal  motion  and  move \n around  okay  give  it  a  shot  give  it  a \n whirl  go  for  it  it's  weird  I  don't  like \n change  he  loves  it  it's  it's  certainly  a \n mouse  this  is  a  laptop  dock  this  is  made \n by  jok  Tech  jock  Tech  Jo  jch  yic  yic \n Tech  wow  this  is  specifically  for  your \n MacBook  uh  we  can  just  put  this  I  don't \n know  wherever  you  let's  go  right  there \n that  thing's  going  to  average  a  solid \n like  302  12  and  10  huh  at  least  at  least \n but  you  need  to  give  it  a  Supporting \n Cast  or  it's  not  going  to  get  a \n championship  then  this  is  The  Supporting \n Cast  you  have  the  cortex  notebook  and \n now  you  need  something  to  write  with  and \n this  is  where  my  vision  comes  into  play \n mhm  a  pen  orange  oh  my  God  how  much  did \n you  spend  on  this  pen  this  is  the  Parker \n jot  pen  it  is  a  classic  in  the  EDC \n Community  it  writes  super  smoothly  to \n give  it  a  wh  now  you're  after  my  heart \n right  now  yeah  so  I  know  you  like  the \n Schmid  Easy  Flow  9000  which  is  the  one \n found  in  our  Ridge  pens  that  is  outside \n the  budget  this  is  10  bucks  and  it's \n also  a  Schmid  something  flow  pen  ink \n something  but  I  like  WR  yeah  there  you \n go  also  you  need  headphones  of  some  sort \n or  speakers  right  now  I  think  you  have \n Logitech  speakers  I \n have  doesn't  matter  they  whatever  yeah \n they're  just  little  OD  despy  yeah \n whatever  I  do  have  nice  headphones \n though  so  I  think  I'm  about  to  get  a \n glow  down  you're  definitely  getting  a \n glow  or  glow  up  okay  it's  like  I  don't \n anchor  sound  core  headphones  for  100 \n bucks  right  here  you  know  what  my \n solution  is  is  instead  of  hooking  it  to \n the  of  my  desk  it's  if  this  is  my  desk \n shelf  it's  hooked  on  and  then  it's  like \n that  this  is  the  chaos  we're  trying  to \n avoid  no  but  why  not  it  then  because  so \n unstable  it's  to  the  well  it's  not \n hooked  on  to  this  shelf  in  particular \n it's  hooked  on  to  something  that  is  St \n but  you  have  a  stable  desk  right  here  I \n have  a  stable  shelf  okay  all  RightWay \n we're  we're  going  with  your  vision  going \n with  the  vision  and  now  we're  on  to  our \n finishing \n touches  this  is  a  toyo  steel  toolbox  I \n like  this  like  you  said  you  have  a  lot \n of  tools  always  going  around  being \n handyman  with  hammers  and  nails  and \n other  things  that \n handyman  this  is  where  you  store  it  all \n look  at  how  deep  that  is  no  no  no  no  no \n oh  where's  it  go  where's  it  go  oh  okay \n yeah  all  right  that's  the  spot  thank  you \n yeah  two  more  notebooks  just  cuz  I  had  a \n spare  $15  orange  and  blue  you  can  see \n where  I'm  going  with  this  you  know  what \n I'm  say  orange  and  blue  notebooks  right \n there  and  then  this  is  more  a  tip  for \n the  people  at  home  watching  so  I  ran  out \n of  money  and  I  could  not \n get  a  monitor  stand  for  you  but  I  know \n you  needed  a  stand  so  quick  easy  way  to \n make  any  at  home  setup  more  you  just \n throw  some  books  on  there  put  the \n monitor  on  top  of  the  books  you  tell  me \n I  don't  read  me  I'm  telling  you  you \n should  read  all  of  these  books  and  then \n put  your  monitor  on  top  of  them  I'm \n sorry  wait  you  were  telling  me  that \n putting  a  clamp  on  a  shelf  is  too \n unsturdy  but  you  want  me  to  put  a  $6,000 \n monitor  on  three  when  you  have  the \n weight  of  that  6,000  $6,000  monitor \n pushing  this  down  it'll  be  nice  and \n sturdy  I'm  sure  I  think  that  works  this \n will  look  a  lot  better  when  there's  a \n bunch  of  stuff  in  it  tada  and  this  is \n the  desk  which  will  look  a  lot  better \n with  things  in  it  but  I  do  have  one  more \n thing  okay  because  I  sit  next  to  you  one \n more  okay  this  you  do  it  like  Harry \n Potter  this  is  a  divider  that  we \n have  I  expected  we  were  going  to  be \n doing  this  at  your  desk  so  I  had  to \n Pivot  we  didn't  previously  have  a \n divider  between  our  desk  so  we  need  to \n have  more  discussion  well  not  between \n our  dust  this  I  put  it  there  for  the \n camera  oh  so  you're  thinking  that  oh  it \n would  be  like  behind  like  right  here  and \n then  you  could  like  I  thought  you  were \n suggesting  that  you  needed  more  space  I \n mean  the  less  I  see  of  you  the  better \n but  no  not  for  this  I  definitely  want  to \n see  my  other  options  I  see  the  utility \n of  it  I  don't  know  if  I  see \n the  the  beauty  of  it  let's  put  it  that \n way  a  solid  like  B  minus  B  i'  want  to \n see  my  other  options  to  see  if  there's \n maybe  an  A+  out  there \n it's  just  like  it's  it's  nice  it's  so \n perfect  all  right  before  we  show  you  VIN \n and  Michael's  desk  we  got  to  build  a \n desk  that  you  can  use  to  make  great \n videos  and  you  can't  do  that  without \n today's  sponsor  which

took  a  look  at  your  desk \n mhm  me  being  who  I  am  I  would  say  I  80% \n focus  on  Vibes  Y  and  maybe  10%  on  Tech \n and  10%  on \n organization  step  one  that's  mat  very \n important  and  this  was  $500  oh  cool  so \n that's  actually  all  that's  it  baby  all \n right  next  up  is  a  dual  purpose  item \n okay  uh  dual  purpose  because  it's \n organization  uh  obviously  I  heard  that \n you  have  a  pesky  neighbor  that  you  that \n you  may  or  may  not  need  a  little  privacy \n from  so  it's  going  to  go  over  here  well \n we  have  more  to  come  Vibe  wise  but  um  I \n spend  a  lot  of  my  money  on  Vibes  so  we \n went  kind  of  budget  Budget  on  headphones \n are  those  budget  headphones  we  have \n Audio  Technica  atm50  x's  and  that  goes \n right  here  cool  The  Vibes  continue  I \n like  that  you're  giving  me  options  first \n on  I  didn't  get  a  lot  of  that  from  Adam \n you  can  also  this  where  things  go  now \n you  could  do  the  clip  thing  you  know \n people  like  that  ooh  that's  nice  oh \n triple  tap  for  more  light  yeah  I  told \n you  I  wouldn't  budget  retro  I  told  you  I \n went  Budget  on  Tech  all  right  um  I  found \n this  in  the  studio  and  I  also  found  it \n on  eBay  for  $30  okay  this  is  uh  the \n Apple  keyboard  from  2000  I  believe  or \n maybe  1999  I  think  both  years  we've  got \n beautiful  color  um  we've  also  got  this \n option  for  do  you  want  it  flat  m \n or  I  heard  you  like  options  somebody \n told  me  you  like  options  I  do  like \n options  yes  complete \n with  USB  ha  to  C  adapter  usb  to  se \n adapter  which  I  did  not  price  what  will \n Apple  think  of  next  oh  all  right  we  got \n the  matching  Mouse  oh  no  this  is  not  the \n Magic  Mouse  the  matching  Mouse  oh  no  no \n I  know  I  know  a  Magic  Mouse  buddy  and \n you  might  be  wondering  do  we  need \n another  adapter  but  actually  would  you \n just  look  at  that  oh  would  you  look  look \n at  that  okay  The  Vibes  continue  okay \n this  is  a  bit  of  storage  as  well \n okay  Cinema  folks  if  you  drop  that  none \n of  us  get  paid  this  month  so  yeah  um  you \n were  asking  about  the  power  on  this  yeah \n oh  it  plugs  into  the  lamp  oh  and  it's \n orange  I  bought  a  little  LED  strip  okay \n and  I  oh  you  added  that  added  on  the \n bottom  of  this  okay  um  I  am  ready \n for  the  big  boy  I \n couldn't  find  this  specific  one  online \n but  I  found  one  on  Amazon  that  is  very \n similar  okay  so  we're  using  this  as  a \n placeholder  for  that  so  the  main  reason \n we  wanted  this  okay  is  obviously  it's \n the  best  way  to  add  personality  to  your \n desk  sure  I  wanted  I  wanted  to  oh  hell \n yeah  gift  you  a  little  look  at  this \n thing  now  I  know  I  know  it's  not  the  uh \n the  official  nxs  logo  but  I  actually \n kind  of  like  the  Retro  it  is  it's  it's \n yeah  it's  retro  feel  like  I'm  watching \n like  Bob  Ross  paint  some  trees  right  now \n that's  that's  quite  the  honor  things  are \n booted  up  oh  my  goodness  it  works  right \n right  away  it  works  right  away  wowow  all \n right  so  the  last  remaining  thing  that  I \n have  for  Vibes  mhm  now  I  know  in  the \n past  you've  been  working  really  hard  on \n a  3D  printed  basketball  I  did  do  that \n and  I  I  would  like  to  to  gift  you  this \n in  reserve  for  when  you  feel  that  you \n have  fully  fully  completed  the  printed \n basketball  and  if  you'll  bear  with  me  I \n can  go  get  the  real  one  as  placeholder \n okay  one  moment  he  didn't  even  insult  me \n once  like  Adam  did  so \n no  boom  so  my  budget  rang  up  in  at  uh \n 475  I  think  okay  so  I  do  have  space  in \n the  budget  for  the  cost  to  print  to \n print  a  b  another  $30  for  my  filament \n heck  yeah  Michael  has  been  my  betting \n line  favorite  going  in  um  I  think  I  was \n just  kind  of  expecting  him  to  come  in \n and  and  wash  the  competition  I  don't \n know  if  I  feel  quite  like  he's  running \n away  with  it  but  I  definitely  feel  like \n he  he  put  on  a  strong  Chell  I  think  he \n appreciated  the  aesthetic  I  don't  think \n there  was  anything  there  that  he  was \n like  I  don't  see  the  value  in  this  so \n will  I  win  I  don't  know  I  don't  know \n what  everyone  else's  ideas  are  so  I \n don't  know  what  I'm  up  against  I  really \n really  like  this  desk  but  I  feel  like \n this  desk  wants  to  change  me  rather  than \n better  me  and  maybe  that's  where  it's \n falling  a  little  short  today  we're \n making  over  a  desk  for  Alex  so  it's \n going  to  be  a  wild  ride  because  I  know \n the  competition  is  fierce  and  we're \n trying  to  win  it  I  appreciate  the \n competitive  Spirit  mhm  mhm  it's  going  to \n be  necessary  I  think  oh  I'm  kind  of \n scared  now  so  the  first  thing  you  want \n on  your  desk  is  just  a  completely \n different  desk  let's  just  get  rid  of \n this  one  oh  cool  all \n right  whoa  wo  new  desk  okay  Grand  reveal \n ready  yes  oo  you  been  to  Home  Depot \n before  this  is  a  husky  desk  the  reason \n why  I  like  this  desk  is  because  it  has \n storage  you  can  see  it's  got  two  two \n doors  right  here  but  I'm  not  going  to \n open  this  this  one  all  the  way  just  yet \n okay  there's  a  surprise  in  there  okay  I \n got  it  first  piece  this  is  a  cutting  mat \n okay  so  useful  for  me  you  can  pretty \n much  just  destroy  this  thing  and  uh  it's \n going  to  take  a  good  beating  there's \n also  two  sides  to  this  so  if  you  want  a \n different  color  I  like  that  color  better \n or  if  you  wanted  a  NYX  blue  you  can  also \n I  could  get  a  blue  one  yeah  oh  shelf \n this  is  a  Vivo  desk  clamp  shelf  it's \n pretty  sturdy  I  think  it  holds  about \n like  maybe  40  lb  this  is  the  Glorious \n model  D2  Pro  a  gaming  mouse  Wireless \n though  USBC  now  because  I  put  an  adapter \n on  there  I  didn't  put  that  in  the  price \n let's  put  them  in  the  drawer  for  now \n okay  good  use  space  see  I  love  these \n drawers  I  heard  you  were  a  gamer  as  well \n so  that's  why  I  got  you  the  gaming  mouse \n play  little  balers  gate  you  know  at  the \n desk  it's  also  lightweight  good  for  your \n wrist  now  that  you're  a  homeowner  yes \n yeah  this  is  a  very  expensive  uh  desk \n shelf  but  we  were  able  to  Source  One  on \n Amazon  for  60  bucks  it's  not  quite  as \n flashy  as  this  one  but  it  is  very  close \n I  like  that  this  basically  matches  with \n this  too  very  good  stuff  so  I  know  that \n you  are  a  Sony  headphone  guy  and  so  I \n wanted  to  continue  that  with  these  Sony \n MDR  7506  these  are  pretty  much  industry \n standard  for  mixing  and  any  kind  of \n audio  use  you  see  them  a  lot  in  a  lot  of \n studios  in  Japan  yeah  Japanese  don't  you \n know  so  Pro  tip  your  cable  is  on  the \n left  side  so  you  should  feed  it  and  have \n it  sit  on  the  left  perfect  mhm  okay  oh \n these  look  familiar  yeah  you've  seen \n these  in  your  setup  before  but  they've \n been  slightly  cleaned  nice  little  eggy \n boys  very  contrasty  wooden  black  oh  all \n right  what  else  we  got  these  are  for \n fighting  what  these  are  actually  is  a  j \n channel  for  cable  management  nice  and \n for  my  last \n trick  online  you  can  find  a  grid \n Infinity  system  which  is  a  little  base \n track  that  you  can  print  multip  of  okay \n to  to  your  liking  and  they've  made  these \n modules  that  you  can  print  out  it  comes \n fitted  with  special  tools  like  a  dial \n caler  or  like  even  Snap-on  tools  which \n is  like  the  Ferrari  of  car  mechanic \n tools  mhm  this  this  is  how  you  try  to \n win  a  competition  you  can  have  it  your \n way  just  like  subway  come  on  come  right \n after  my  heart  right  here  I  think  we're \n pretty  much  done  here  let's  put  on  the \n final  touches  on  Wheel  oh  this  is \n already  you're  winning  bonus  points  for \n this
