let's  go \n [Music] \n that's  looking \n cute  oh  cute  yeah  whenever  I  go  shopping \n for  a  friend  the  best  way  to  know  kind \n of  what  to  get  them  is  L  to  look  at \n their  Instagram  beforehand  see  what  kind \n of  aesthetic  they  usually  have  what \n color  jewelry  and  bags  they  usually  have \n she  has  a  lot  of  Gold  bags  so  maybe  she \n doesn't  like  silver  as  much  those  kinds \n of  details  you  sometimes  don't  know  so \n just  like  review  your  friends's \n Instagram  before  shopping  for \n them  two  down  five  to  go  yes \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n [Music] \n I  got  Kim  her  first  $20  La  smoothie \n let's  get  your \n reaction  it's  not  like \n Boba  no  girl  it's  not  like \n Boba  wait  oh  it's  actually  really  good \n what  wo  it's  really  yummy  but  is  it \n worth  $20 \n you  like  it  yeah  would  you  wear  it  I \n would  yeah  we'll  get  it  for  you  then \n really  yeah  congrats  on  your  graduation \n oh  my \n God  thank  you  po  Jamie  yes  and  then  the \n black  one  for \n you  let's  go  on  a  little  morning  walk \n and  keep \n yapping  cheers  nothing  makes  me  happy \n quite  like  a  morning  walk  and  a  matcha \n like  sometimes  I  feel  like  it's  all  I \n need  and  I  need  it  every \n day  I  brought  you  guys  to  my  favorite \n Park  I  remember  not  too  long  ago  I  came \n to  the  park  there  was  this  couple  here \n and  they  were  sad  and  they  were  just \n like  making  out  not  like  like  they  were \n on  top  of  each  other  like  they  were \n basically  like  69ing  at  the  park  and  for \n some  reason  that's  a  really  fond  memory \n to  me  for  some  reason  I'm  like  you  know \n what  they're  probably  so  in \n love  like  was  it  appropriate  for  public \n consumption  maybe  not  at  the  park  like \n there  are  babies  here  then  again  babies \n don't  even  know  what  the  [ __ ]  going  on \n I  don't  know  where  this  train  of  thought \n is  going  but  regardless  actually \n speaking  of  Love  um  I'm  going  through  a \n breakup  that  is  a  cookie  beans \n transition  bye  okay  I've  never  really \n talked  about  a  breakup  before  and \n because  I  don't  really  like  date  people \n in  the  public  eye  it  doesn't  really  feel \n like  it  makes  sense  to  either  but  I  felt \n like  this  one  might  be  interesting  to \n discuss  for  a  couple  reasons  ah  where \n shall  I  go  with  this  frankly  this \n breakup  feels  different  than  past  ones \n you  know  like  it's  not  my  first  time \n it's  not  my  first  time  in  this  Rodeo  but \n when  you're  in  your  like  mid  to  late  20s \n and  when  you  start  envisioning  your  life \n with  someone  speaking  about  marriage  and \n kids  and  like  really  being  in  that  head \n space  and  planning  for  your  future  and \n then  all  of  that  kind  of  dissolves  you \n know  it's  a  lot  to  process  I  also  feel \n like  sometimes  it  just  makes  me  feel  so \n much  better  to  get  things  off  my  chest \n with  you  guys  or  to  express  it  and  then \n sometimes  people  are  like  oh  I  totally \n get  it  or  that  resonates  with  me  or  I \n feel  you  or  this  is  what  helped  so \n anyways  if  you  are  or  have  been  going \n through  a  breakup  just  know  one  you're \n so  not  alone  for  some  reason  I  feel  like \n it's  breakup  season  like  I  know  so  many \n people  that  have  broken  up  two  time \n heals  all  and  you're  kind  of  supposed  to \n feel  like  [ __ ]  for  a  little  while  so \n it's  going  to  be  okay  and  I  also  felt \n like  it  might  be  nice  to  talk  about \n because  who  I  date  usually  isn't  in  the \n public  eye  so  it's  kind  of  just  like  why \n not  share  my  perspective  of  things  or \n like  what  I'm  going  through  especially \n if  it  doesn't  hurt  anyone  kind  of  thing \n I  feel  like  for  the  last  year  or  two \n I've  been  intentionally  keeping  to \n myself  a  bit  more  just  because  I've  been \n online  for  so  long  and  I've  been  so  in \n the  public  eye  for  so  long  I  wanted  just \n a  couple  years  to  myself  a  couple  years \n to  be  more  private  things  like  that  but \n now  honestly  I  kind  of  really  miss  you \n guys  I  miss  sharing  more  of  my  life  and \n I  still  find  a  lot  of  joy  in  that  I'm \n trying  to  get  out  of  my  shell  a  little \n bit  more  especially  now  that  I'm \n single  sorry  it's  not  gross  to  be  single \n it's  gross  to  [ __ ]  date  in  LA \n [Music] \n there  is  no  one  to  date  here  except  like \n the  dogs  in  that  Park  the  dogs  in  that \n Park  are  better  than  the  [ __ ] \n dogs  out  in  the  dating  world  if  you  know \n I'm \n saying \n like  anyways  that's  a  concern  for \n another  day  right  now  in  life  my \n concerns  and  priorities  are  with  myself \n let's  head  back  home \n [Music] \n that  was  a  really  annoying  shot  to  set \n up  I  hope  you  guys  appreciate \n it  what  do  I  want  to  wear  today \n sweatpants  leggings  both  neither  these \n stretchy  sweatpants  so  it's  like  you're \n wearing  sweatpants  and  leggings \n in  one  top  toity \n dop  simple  top  I'm  not  really  going  out \n today  so  I  don't  need  anything  crazy \n y  who's  this  they  haven't  seen  you  in  so \n long  say \n hi  say \n hi \n anything  that's  crazy  cuz  usually  she \n can't  shut  the  Fu  up  to  be  honest  kind \n of  like \n me  I'm  wondering  like  how  much  I  should \n show  you  guys  of  my  new  apartment  this \n is  my  living \n [Music] \n room  my  dinner  table  which  seats  just \n [Music] \n me  my  kitchen  show  you  guys  more  in \n detail  as  we \n [Music] \n go  let's  grab  some  food  for \n now  just  a  girl  in  her  meal  prep  what \n can  I  say  today  we're  having  veggies \n chicken  rice  I'll  be  right \n back  wow  it  heats  up  here's  another  face \n you  guys  haven't  seen  in  a  little  while \n say  hi  B  he  is  so  cute  he  just  a  bean \n these  things  have  maintained  my  sanity \n for  years  legit  I  love  them  so  much  I \n would  die  for \n you \n anyways  yeah  okay  mix  it  up  mix  it  up \n then  huh  listen  I  know  that  this  sauce \n comes  with  it  but  what  I  really  want  to \n do  is  put  some  Sriracha  in  there  I've \n just  been  obsessed  with  Sriracha \n recently  I  don't  know  why  it  took  me \n this  long  to  have  a  Sriracha  kick  but \n she's  here  and  she's  not  going \n anywhere  oh  good  meal  prep  healthy  meal \n is  so  important  to  me  I  will  always  be \n willing  to  spend  on  food  also  I've  been \n gyming  I'm  really  proud  because  I  feel \n like  for  the  last  couple  years  Health \n has  been  at  the  top  of  my  list  of \n priorities  and  I've  implemented  a  lot  of \n pretty  healthy  habits  even  though  I'm \n not  perfect  with  it  even  though \n sometimes  when  I  travel  or  [ __ ]  happens \n and  habits  can  take  a  pause  or  be  on  the \n back  burner  for  a  bit  regardless  it's \n something  that  I  keep  coming  back  to  so \n that  makes  me  really  happy  and  proud  of \n myself  I  work  with  the  trainer  sometimes \n sometimes  I  go  the  gym  alone  either  way \n it's  a  good \n time  know  one  food  is  show  good  to  makx \n you  want  to  dance  I've  also  been  taking \n Arabic  lessons  which  is  so  cool  I  know \n the  Moroccan  Arabic  dialect  but  that's \n such  like  a  niche  dialect  like  non- \n Moroccans  wouldn't  understand  it  so  I'm \n trying  to  learn  a  more  common  dialect \n which  is  called  Leones  I  think  like \n Lebanese  sort  of  and  just  be  able  to \n converse  a  little  bit  or  even  like  make \n short  little  videos  in  I  think  that \n would  be  so  cool  and  it's  something  I've \n always  wanted  to  do  like  my  whole  life \n except  when  I  was  really  young  and  my \n parents  forced  me  into  language \n lessons  do  but  aside  from  that  I  have \n always  wanted  to  get  better  at  Arabic  so \n I'm  doing  that  now  and  honestly  those \n Arabic  lessons  make  me  feel  so  fulfilled \n like  I  don't  know  why  I'm  so  proud  of \n myself  after  I  do \n them  and  then  maraba  at  least  that  one's \n easy  could  you  maybe  give  me  an  example \n sentence  in  both  of  those \n dialects \n me  so  if  you've  been  thinking  about \n learning  a  language  especially  if  it's  a \n part  of  your  culture  or  your  family  but \n you're  unsure  take  this  as  a  sign  to  do \n it  like  please  please  do  it  okay  I'm \n more  friend \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n [Music] \n this \n [ __ ]  this  [ __ ]  another  health  related \n thing  not  too  long  ago  was  diagnosed \n with  PCOS  which  is  a  pretty  large \n umbrella  term  I  would  say  like  people \n have  PCOS  in  a  lot  of  different  ways \n they  have  different  symptoms  they  have \n different  everything  for  me  personally \n it  just  means  my  hormones  can  kind  of  be \n in  balanced  really  easily  if  I'm \n stressed  like  if  I  stress  or  if  I'm  not \n taking  care  of  myself  really  well  then  I \n don't  get  my  period  or  my  period  is \n irregular  hormonal  stuff  like  that  just \n like  learning  about  the  symptoms  how  to \n manage  them  how  to  manage  my  health  in \n general  has  been  such  a  journey  such  an \n up  and  down  journey  and  not  really  easy \n because  it's  something  that  people \n didn't  really  used  to  diagnose  before  so \n I'm  learning  a  lot  and  I  wanted  to  take \n the  time  to  learn  on  my  own  before  I \n spoke  to  you  guys  about  this  and  I  think \n it  wasn't  easy  for  me  to  initially \n because  having  a  diagnosis  of  anything \n can  feel  so  scary  like  you  can  feel  like \n oh  my  God  something  is  wrong  with  me  but \n in  reality  girl  everybody  got  something \n for  starters  and  secondly  it's  good \n because  you  can  better  learn  how  to  take \n care  of  yourself  and  how  to  prevent \n certain  issues  I  try  to  see  any \n diagnosis  as  more  of  an  answer  than  a \n problem  it's  not  easy  but  let  me  show \n you  guys  guys  what  else  my  days  consist \n of  honestly  my  days  consist  of  a  whole \n lot  of  this  being  sat  in  my  stream  room \n answering  emails  answering  messages \n answering  my  managers  agents  just  all \n this  stuff  but  I'm  so  lucky  and  so \n grateful  and  I  think  sometimes  it  can  be \n easy  to  get  swept  up  in  like  the  hate  or \n the  stress  or  the  negatives  but  actually \n when  I  focus  on  the  good  [ __ ]  I  love  my \n life  I  love  the  people  that  support  me  I \n kind  of  love  this  [ __ ]  I'm  trying  to \n keep  my  head  on  straight  and  I  still  do \n be  streaming  sometimes  I  know  there  was \n a  period  of  time  where  people  thought \n like  I  quit  streaming  entirely  there \n were  some  clickbait  articles  but  I  also \n did  a  podcast  episode  where  I  was \n talking  about  my  twitch  contract  being \n up  and  how  I  would  be  kind  of  dabbling \n in  different  things  so  people  took  that \n as  me  quitting  or  like  me  saying \n quitting  like  the  contract  but  the \n contract  doesn't  mean  I'm  going  to  stop \n streaming  and  harly  and  as  you  guys \n probably  see  I  still  love  to  stream  like \n a  couple  times  a  week  and  aside  from \n that  I  just  post  on  socials  or  work  on \n other  things  or  do  podcast  stuff  oh  I'm \n so  excited  to  announce  something  in \n relation  to  the  podcast  soon  yeah  it's \n just  been  so  great  to  diversify  and  I \n think  it's  what  I've  been  looking  for \n for  a  really  long  time  as  you  guys  know \n like  a  year  and  a  half  or  something  ago \n I  made  a  video  where  I  was  like  guys \n it's  time  to  do  some  other  [ __ ]  I  don't \n know  if  I  can  stream  in  the  way  that  I \n have  been  the  last  like  six  years  I  feel \n like  other  platforms  fit  into  my  LIF \n style  nowadays  a  little  bit  better  and  I \n think  streaming  and  gaming  still  does \n fit  in  there  it  just  doesn't  have  to  be \n everything  and  I  think  this  Middle \n Ground  of  like  still  streaming  sometimes \n and  doing  other  stuff  aside  from  that  is \n just  perfect  for  me  in  this  period  of  my \n life  and  who  knows  what's  going  to \n happen  in  2  3  4  5  6  months  maybe  a \n game's  going  to  come  out  that  I'm \n obsessed  with  and  I'll  do  that  or  maybe \n I'll  find  a  passion  elsewhere  and  I'll \n tunnel  in  on  that  I'm  just  allowing  my \n the  freedom  to  explore  and  I'm  so \n grateful  for  the  people  who  care  to  go \n on  that  Journey  alongside \n [Music] \n me  this  is  literally  how  I  sit  when  I \n work \n this  is  a  real  POV  currently  working \n with  cutie  on  something  but  it's  secret \n and  this  is  what  I  do  usually  in  the \n later  afternoon  as  a  break  I  play \n valerant  with  my \n friends  yipp

be \n H \n holy  let's  go  there  is  no  way  oh  my  God \n oh  my  God  oh  my  God  I  just  played  for  3 \n hours  but  it  was  kind  of  just  what  I \n needed  now  I'm  going  to  sit  down  watch \n some  TV  and  have  a  chill  night  and  yeah \n signal  on  a \n quest  chance  massive \n [Music]",
