  "transcript": "All  right,  so  we're  doing  EDC  a  little \n bit  different  this  time.  Obviously,  I'm \n going  to  be  taking  a  look  at  everybody \n else's  daily  carries  and  then  doing  a \n bit  of  a  draft  and  picking  my  favorites \n of  the  bunch. \n I  don't  know  what  size  this  is.  It's  the \n Moment  backpack.  It's  got  lots  of \n pockets.  It's  got  lots  of  I  This  thing \n rules.  It's  so  collapsible.  The  main \n pocket  is  so  big.  The  laptop  pocket  is \n so  tight.  I  just  think  I  also  am  a  big \n fan  of  sunscreen. \n I'm  also  a  big  fan  of  the  Moment  sling \n pouch.  Uh,  this  is  what  I  use  as  a \n camera  bag  when  I'm  shooting.  This  thing \n just  constantly  amazes  me  that  it  has \n four \n pockets.  So,  I  um  I  I  got  a  bag  and  uh \n do  I  recommend  it?  Not  particularly.  Is \n it \n yellow?  Yes. \n The  thing  that  houses  everything  is  this \n main  bag  from  Urban  Outfitters.  I  don't \n know  what  it's  called,  but  it  was  a \n really  cheap  bag  about \n $15.  It  has  a  P  show  piece  from  Avatar \n the  Last  Air  Bender.  Nice  little \n accessory  on  there.  Also  a  sticker  from \n my  niece  on  it.  I  keep  a  Opal  C1 \n flathead  just  in  case  for  any  camera \n plates.  They  always  use  a  flathead.  So, \n my  bag  is  the  the  Ridge  MKBHD  edition \n bag  with  my  own  little  name  plate  on \n here.  Pretty  cool.  It's  very \n very  shilly  of  me.  Yes,  I  I  use  a  lot  of \n Ridge  products.  Go  figure.  My  favorite \n thing  about  this  backpack  is  that  it \n opens  up  entirely  flat.  So,  like  boom, \n whole  bag  open.  And  then  you  can  use  it \n just  like  that  for  the  top  section. \n plus  a  computer  sleeve.  So,  within  this \n bag,  it  holds  another  bag  for  groceries. \n This  is  a  bagu  that  Brandon  got  me  for \n my  birthday.  This  is  a  magic  trick  every \n time.  Check  this \n out.  Wait,  let  me  let  me  do  one  of \n these.  That's  like  a  10gon  hat,  no? \n Like,  that's  a  lot  of \n gallons.  Uh,  this  is  the  Moment  bag. \n I've  heard  good  things  about  the  Moment \n bag,  and  I  think  that's  mostly  in  build \n quality.  Um,  I'm  not  mad  at  it.  I  just \n happen  to  like  a  little  more  color.  I \n mean,  this  is  truly  matte  black \n everything,  but  a  little  red  accent \n would  be  nice.  This  one's  actually \n interesting.  Like,  you  can  get  like  a \n phone,  some  headphones,  a  little  power \n bank,  some  cables  in  here.  So,  yeah,  I \n can  I  can  tell  this  is  an  early \n prototype  version  of  the  backpack  cuz \n it's  missing  some  of  the  red  a  lit  thing \n accent  pieces.  I  don't  know  what  they're \n called,  but  uh  yeah,  I  daily  carry  the \n backpack  that  I  helped  design.  Shocker. \n Okay,  so  I'm  Miles,  autofocus  producer \n here  at  the  studio  and  this  is  my  EDC. \n Some  things  have  changed,  some  things \n have  not.  Going  into  what  has  not \n changed,  my  headphones  of  choice,  the \n Dyson  earbuds.  So,  I  did  try  the  newest \n pair  of  Dyson  headphones  that  we \n reviewed  on  the  MKBHD  channel.  But \n firstly,  I  didn't  find  that  audio \n quality  was  substantially  improved.  And \n secondly,  it  didn't  come  with  an \n attachment  point  for  this  bad  boy  right \n here,  the  air  filter  thing.  That \n definitely  works.  Put  it  on  like  that, \n you're  chilling.  So,  I  mean,  if  you \n catch  me  at  like  the  grocery  store  or \n something  like  that,  this  is  what  you \n would  see.  It's  so  weird  to  just  look  at \n your  life  like  laid  out  on  a  table.  It's \n not  a  thing  you  normally  do.  A  lot  of \n the  planning  and  collaboration  in  this \n office  happens  at  our  desks.  So,  I  often \n times  don't  want  to  be  totally  locked  in \n my  headphones.  I  want  to  be  able  to  hear \n what's  happening.  And  often  times  pass \n through  it  ends  up  elevating  background \n noises  that I  don't  want  to  hear.  So,  I \n use  the  Bose  Ultra  Open  when  I'm  at  my \n desk.  Uh,  these  are  great.  They  uh  are \n just  hook  on  to  your  ears  like  that  so  I \n can  hear  everything  that's  going  on \n around  me,  but  then  I  can  also  listen  to \n what's  happening  on  my  computer.  If  for \n whatever  reason  I  do  want  to  tune  my \n co-workers  out,  which  is  rare,  then  I \n use  um  Marquez's  old  uh  AirPods  Max.  Uh \n these  ones  have  the  lightning  port  at \n the  bottom,  but  look,  they're  great. \n They  stick  with  your  computer.  They're \n really  easy  to  listen  to.  They  keep  good \n charge.  Usually,  ideally,  the  uh  ear  the \n nothing \n ear.  Uh,  these  are  actually  the  Nothing \n Ear  Ones  because  mine  are  at  home \n stewing  in  my  sweat  because  I  work  out \n in  them  a  lot.  Um,  they're  great.  They \n got  some  really  good  noise  cancellation. \n They're  comfortable.  It's  very  designer \n core.  I  need  everything  to  be  designer \n core  cuz  I'm  I  am  a  designer  after  all. \n AirPods  Pro.  Using  AirPods  with  an \n Android  device  is  not  ideal  and  it \n causes  so  many  problems,  but  these  ones \n just  fit  my  ears  really  well  and  I  won't \n be  caught  dead  with  those  weird  like \n little  rubber  tip  things.  So,  I  love \n these.  Highly  recommend  splurging  for \n the  more  expensive  ones  with  noise \n cancellation.  Um,  but  they're  a  little \n bit  cheaper.  They  have  USBC  and  they're \n pretty  great.  So,  my  headphones  are  the \n Audio  Technica  ATTH  M20X's.  The  big \n reason  I  bought  these  is  because  I  was \n living  in  Chicago  and  I  needed  something \n to  keep  my  ears  warm  in  the  winter. \n Shout  out  Chicago,  greatest  city  on \n earth.  The  other  big  reason  that  I  like \n these  is  honestly  because  even  though \n the  sound  quality  is  solid  and  the \n hardware  is  solid  and  the  battery  life \n is  great,  I  like  these  because  if  I  lost \n them,  I  would  be  okay  with  that  reality. \n This  is  now  the  third  time  I've  come  on \n an  EDC  video  with  the  same  headphones. \n Foccal  bathies.  Are  these  the  best \n headphones  for  an  audio  professional? \n No.  Are  these  the  headphones  I  would \n recommend  to  someone  who  wants  to  buy \n nice  headphones?  No.  Are  they  the  best \n headphones  for  what  I  do  here?  Probably. \n I  I  haven't  found  anything  that  I  like \n more.  They  sound  great.  They  have  very \n low  distortion  in  the  mid-range,  which \n is  really  important  for  me  when  I'm \n mixing.  Uh  I  would  never  tell  anyone  to \n buy  them.  And  they're  like,  at least \n when  they  came  out,  they  were  $600, \n which  to  me  is  like  way  too  much  for  a \n nonproduction  headphone.  Whoever  put \n these  there  is  trolling  me.  That's  fine. \n Dyson  headphones.  I  don't  even  think \n they  sound  good  as  headphones,  let  alone \n this  part.  So,  Miles,  yeah,  I'm  going  to \n say  for  my  flying  on  a  plane  headphone \n pick,  I'll  go  with  the  Focals.  I  think \n this  is  going  to  be  awesome.  And  I  think \n for  my  walk  around  the  studio  earbuds \n experience,  I'm  going to  go  with  the \n Bose  Open  Ultras.  I  think  these  are  both \n really  solid.  The  Bats  noise  cancelling \n is  uh  it's  not  bad,  but  it's  not \n AirPods.  It's  not  airplane.  Would  you \n fly  on  a  plane  with  them?  No. \n Now,  considering  I  specifically  would \n want  headphones  like  this  to  get  on  the \n plane  and  be  in  my  own  world,  that's \n going  to  matter.  that's  going  to  weigh \n in  for  me.  So,  I'm  switching  to  the \n AirPods  Max,  but  yeah,  keeping  the  Bose. \n So,  earbud,  headphone.  For  my  wallet,  I \n like  to  use  one  of  the  really  MKBHD \n wallets.  I  like  having  the  elastic  so \n it's  not  just  like  a  hard  clam  shell.  I \n can  just  like  open  it  and  just  kind  of \n see  what's  in  there.  My  pockets  are  very \n small  and  so  my  wallet  has  to  be  very \n tiny.  I'm  not  a  super  like  opinionated \n like  wallet  person,  but  I've  been  using \n the  Ridge  wallet  and  I  like  it.  I  have \n yet  to  find  myself  wanting  to  go  back  to \n a  more  traditional  style  wallet.  Ridge \n makes  metal  wallets  which  are  cool  and \n I've  tried  them,  but  like  for  everyday \n carry,  they're  just  not  for  me.  So,  I \n was  really  waiting  for  them  to  come  out \n with  a  leather  wallet  or  a  soft  wallet \n and  they  did.  So,  this  is  the  leather \n biffold  and  I  really  like  it.  I  have  a \n couple  cards  in  here,  some  cash,  and \n it's  still  so  slim.  Like,  look  at  that. \n I  don't  like  the  slim  wallets.  I  don't \n like  the  the  push  wallets.  I  don't  like \n the  metal.  Like  I  I've  never  enjoyed \n those.  But  I  do  like  a  good  oldfashioned \n biffold.  I  got  cards.  I  got  my  ID.  I  got \n uh  500 \n pesos.  I'm  definitely  one  of  those \n people  that  has  way  too  much  stuff  in \n their  wallet  at  all  times.  Usually \n people  carry  one  wallet,  but  I  have  two \n because  this  one  holds  all  the  cards, \n specifically  my  Yu-Gi-Oh  card.  This \n second  one  just  holds  cash  because  I \n don't  like  holding  cash  in  this  one.  You \n can't  hold  that  much  cash  in  a  card \n wallet,  but  in  a  pouch  you  could  put \n coins  in  here,  your  Chuck-E-Cheese \n coins.  My  wallet  is  this  lovely  wallet \n from  Segrid.  My  favorite  thing  about \n this  wallet  is  where  I  got  it.  I  was  in \n the  Netherlands  and  I  was  like,  damn, \n they  built  these  canals  how  many \n hundreds  of  years  ago  and  they  still \n hold  up.  So,  I  figured  if  I  was  going  to \n buy  something  that  I'd  use  every  single \n day  that  would  have  a  moving  piece,  I \n may  as  well  get  it  in  the  Netherlands \n where  they  clearly  have  a  lot  of \n engineering  prowess.  While  there's  a \n little  bit  of  scuffing  on  the  leather  on \n the  outside,  I  actually  think  that  it \n gives  it  character  makes  it  feel  like \n it's  more  of  mine  and  its  utility,  its \n ability  to  open  up  regularly  and  it's  I \n don't  know,  general  walletness  still \n pretty  solid.  I've  never  Oh,  what? \n Actually,  that's  kind  of  fire.  Okay,  so \n these  are  all  the  wallets.  Me \n personally,  minimal  wallet  person.  These \n are  kind  of  like  the  more  foldy \n traditional  types.  Full  grain  leather \n wallet.  It's  pretty  nice.  Look,  your  boy \n loves  a  Ridge  wallet.  Uh,  but  I  like  a \n soft  wallet \n more.  The  Trove  wallet,  which  I  also \n really  like.  Carried  for  a  long  time. \n Yu-Gi-Oh  card.  Another  great  design.  You \n guys  are  really  outdoing  it.  But  I  think \n I'm  going  to  stick  with  this  small,  slim \n one.  Second  place  was  is  definitely \n this.  It's  too  thick  for  my  liking,  but \n that's  fire.  Yeah,  I'm  going  to  stick \n with  Is  this  actually  a  Ridge  wallet? \n Oh,  sick.  I  didn't  even  know  this  was  a \n Ridge  wallet.  Uh  yeah,  I'm  sticking  with \n the  minimal  one.  Couple  cards,  a  little \n bit  of  cash  if  I  need  it.  Probably  won't \n have  it,  though.  Just  like  six  or  seven \n little  pieces  of  plastic  in  my  back \n pocket.  Watch.  This  is  a  watch  that  is \n called  the  solid  state  watch.  It  is  from \n our  friends  in  Brooklyn  called  uh \n Teenage  Engineer.  No,  C  CWntt. \n Rich  knows.  I  don't,  but  Rich \n knows.  CW  NT.  Um,  basically  it  is  a  it \n is  a  watch  that  is  encased  in  resin.  It \n lasts  about  10  years.  Um,  then  after \n that  it  becomes  a  paper  weight.  But  what \n I  love  about  this  is  it  just  it's  funky \n looking,  but  it's  it's  a  conversation \n piece.  It's  a  funky  watch.  So  I  use  a \n OnePlus  Watch  3  as  like  a  Android  guy.  I \n think  this  is  the  the  best  Android  watch \n out  there  pretty  much  bar  none.  So  I \n wear  two  watches  some  days  and  everyone \n makes  fun  of  me  and  that's  okay.  This  is \n my  preferred  watch.  It's  a  to  visate.  I \n like  it  because  it's  automatic.  So \n hopefully  you  guys  can  hear  this. \n It's  just  a  nice  wristwatch.  Uh,  it  goes \n with  everything.  It's  pretty  classic. \n The  other  watch  I  carry,  Apple  Watch \n Ultra  2.  I  wouldn't  say  I'm  like  a  a  gym \n bro  or  anything  like  that,  but  I  do  take \n my  fitness  relatively  seriously.  Uh,  and \n that's  why  I  have  the  Apple  Watch  Ultra \n because  you  you  buy  the  Ultra  for  ultra \n fitness.  Even  though  yes,  people  say \n it's  not  very  accurate  for  the  calorie \n counter,  step  counter,  whatever,  at \n least  has  something  for  me  to  keep \n track.  And  so  far,  within  about  3 \n months,  oh,  actually  and  a  4  months,  I'm \n down  20  lbs.  And  this  watch  helped  me \n keep  track  of  my  fitness  during  our \n week-long  fitness  competition  that  we \n ran  here  in  the  studio  where  I  actually \n took  the  victory.  I  swept  everyone, \n including  Marquez.  It  wasn't  even  close \n for  pretty  much  anyone.  I  know  some \n people  would  argue  that  a  Pixel  Watch \n would  be  a  better  choice,  especially \n given  that  I  don't  use  iOS  as  my  main \n like  daily  driver  smartphone.  I  can \n understand  why  people  would  dislike  the \n Pixel  Watch  and  I  hear  you  and  I  see  you \n and  I  agree  with  you  for  the  most  part. \n What  can  I  say  about  the  Pixel  Watch? \n It's  It's  so  great.  We  love  it  so  much. \n Um,  they  finally,  it  only  took  2  years \n for  them  to  add  public  transit \n information  to  that.  So,  that  was  really \n big  W  for  me  personally.  I've  been  using \n the  Pixel  Watch  3.  I  have  been  really \n enjoying  this  thing.  I  got  the  cellular \n version  cuz  I'm  on  Google  Fi.  So,  they \n had  like  a  promotion  where  you  don't \n have  to  pay  for  service.  So,  when  I  go \n on  a  run,  this  is  the  cellular  version, \n so  I  don't  even  need  to  bring  my  phone. \n I  only  need  my  watch.  I  can  listen  to \n podcasts  on  here,  listen  to  my  running \n playlist.  I  could  still  answer  messages, \n take  phone  calls,  everything.  It's  It's \n all  on  here. \n We're  not  going  to  show  you  the  options \n for  phones.  So,  you  have  to  choose  a \n watch  first.  Okay.  So,  I've  reviewed \n these.  I  have  not  reviewed  these.  I  got \n to  test  this.  It's  actually  very  good. \n It's  one  of  the  best,  maybe  the  best \n Androidbased  smart  watches.  Um, \n multi-day  battery  life.  There's  actually \n a  lot  going  for  this  thing.  So,  that's \n cool.  Um,  I'm  just  going  to  say  it  now. \n I  was  never  going  to  pick  the \n uh  watch.  So,  spoiler,  I  am  a  smartwatch \n person.  I  have  my  own  smartwatch  for \n things  like  notifications,  uh,  workout \n tracking,  closing  my  rings.  I  mean,  I \n use  an  Apple  Watch  Ultra,  so  that's \n that's  the  easy  pick.  I  mean,  here's  the \n thing.  If  I  pick  an  Apple  Watch,  I  have \n to  pick  an  iPhone.  And  if  I \n pick  a  non-Apple  Watch,  then  I  can  use \n an  Android  phone.  So,  I'm  going  to  pick \n an  I'm  going  to  pick  an  Android  watch. \n I'm  going  to  pick  the  OnePlus  Watch  3. \n Uh,  you  know,  I'm  a  man  of  culture.  I'm \n a  man  of  class.  I'm  a  man  of  taste.  And \n uh  unlike  the  rest  of  the  bozos  who  work \n here,  I  figure  I  could  show  you  what  a \n man  of  taste  actually  uses  every  day.  I \n bought  a  Canon  EOSM.  This  is  a  13  or \n 14year-old \n uh  mirrorless  camera  made  by  Canon.  It \n was  actually  the  first  mirrorless  camera \n they  ever  made.  And  so  I  got  this  as  a \n video  camera  actually,  but  ended  up \n falling  in  love  with  still  photography. \n If  you  are  shooting  digital  and  need  a \n little  cheat  code,  uh,  I  would  recommend \n getting  one  of these.  This  is  a  Canon \n FD50  mil  F1.4.  This  thing,  if  you're  bad \n at  taking  pictures,  oh  my  god,  no  one \n will  know  with  this  lens.  For  the \n autofocus  videos,  that's  obviously  shot \n on  iPhone,  but  when  I'm  not  shooting \n autofocus  stuff,  I  use  this.  This  is  the \n Canon  R5  Mark  II.  This  is  simply  the \n best  mirrorless  camera  you  can  buy.  Red, \n forget  about  it.  Sony,  definitely  forget \n about  it.  This  is  all  you  need.  Shoots \n 8K  video  and  multiple  different  codecs. \n Now  we  have  CLOG  2,  so  colors  are  nice \n and  right  straight  out  of  the  box.  Uh, \n autofocus  is  even  better.  It  doesn't \n overheat  as  much  anymore.  You've  got \n full  size  HDMI.  You  can  now  power  it \n using  USBC  cable.  This  camera  simply \n does  everything  I  need.  This  is  the \n goated  camera  right  here.  Sony  could \n never.  This  is  the  Fujifilm  X100S. \n It  is  Marquez's  old  camera  that  he  no \n longer  uses.  Everyone's  like,  \"Oh  my \n god,  you  got  the  new  like  X1006.\"  And \n I'm  like,  \"You  thought  this  is  the  older \n one?\"  Like,  everyone  that  I  show \n pictures  to  that  I've  taken  with  this \n camera  is  still  blown  away  by  it.  So, \n this  is  my  daily  camera.  It's  the \n Fujifilm  X1006.  My  favorite  thing  about \n this  camera  is  the  everyday  filter  I \n have  on  there.  It's  a  little  mist  plus \n polarizer.  So  when  I  shoot  into  the  sun \n or  to  lights,  it  pops  a \n little.  I'm  a  photographer.  I  guess  I'll \n just  say  my  theme  is  generally  maxing \n out  my  utility.  And  even  in  the  littlest \n things,  like  this  being  a  fixed  lens,  I \n know  you  can  change  aperture  and  it's \n very  satisfying  because  of  the  clicking \n wheel.  I  want  zoom.  And  so  I  end  up \n leaning  towards  something  where  I  can \n interchange  lenses.  I  mean,  the  Mark  the \n R5  Mark  II  is  literally  one  of  my \n favorite  cameras.  I  don't  daily  carry \n one,  but  if  you  made  me  daily  carry  a \n camera,  it  would  be  this  one.  An \n accessory  I  use  every  single  day  is  this \n power  bank  from  Journey.  I  like  it \n because  you  can  charge  an  Apple  Watch, \n Mag  Safe  your  phone,  and  do  wireless \n charging.  It's  10,000  mAh.  I  think  that \n this  sliding  mechanism,  even  though  it \n will  probably  betray  me  one  day,  has  not \n betrayed  me  yet.  Absolutely  love  this \n thing.  It  is  how  I  charge  everything  all \n the  time.  And  it's  great  for  travel \n because  I  just  need  one  USBC  cable  and \n then  I  can  charge  up  everything  I  own. \n Not  an  ad.  I  actually  just  truly  really \n love  it.  Ridg's  new  magnetic  power  bank, \n Mag  Safe,  watch  charger,  integrated \n cables,  kickstand,  little  display, \n 10,000  mAh,  charges  like  phones  up  to \n like  three  times.  This  is  what  I  really \n love.  It  has  a  lightning  cable  built  in. \n This  has  effectively  allowed  me  to  get \n rid  of  every  single  lightning  cable  in \n my  house.  So,  I  don't  need  like  six  more \n cables.  All  gone.  The  ring  I  wear  is  the \n Ultra  Human  Air  in  stainless  steel.  And \n there's  actually  a  really  great  story \n with  this.  When  me  and  Miles  were  in \n Portugal,  uh  Ferrari's  chief  test \n driver,  Rafa,  actually  wore  this  ring. \n So,  he  actually  put  it  on  his  finger. \n He's  like, \"This  thing's  kind  of  cool,  I \n guess.\"  And  then  like  he  wore  it  for \n like,  I  want  to  say  5  10  minutes.  I  was \n just  like,  \"That's  kind  of  cool.\"  So, \n yeah.  through  the  transitive  property. \n I've  driven  every  Ferrari  since  the \n early  2000s  and  I  am  infinitely  cooler \n than  all  of  you. \n So,  these  are  my  my  Meta  Ray-B  bands  and \n I  love  these.  I  mean,  these  are  like, \n you  know,  one  of  my  favorite  pieces  of \n tech  that  I've  bought  in  the  last  couple \n years.  You  know,  being  able  to  listen  to \n music  while  you're  walking  around,  it's \n it  without  having  like  headphones  in,  so \n you  could  be  a  little  more  present.  They \n look  clear  when  I'm  wearing  them  like \n this,  but  then  when  I  step  outside  and \n stare  into  the  sun,  which  is  something  I \n do  like  all  the  time,  they  transition  so \n that  I  have  proper  sunglasses  and  I'm \n slightly  more  protected  from  the  rays  of \n the  sun  with  my  ray  bands.  I  think  the \n cameras  on  these  are  actually  really \n good,  especially  if  you  have  a  ton  of \n light.  And  they  just  added  AI  features \n where  it'll  do  live  translation  for \n Spanish,  French,  and  Italian. \n feature. \n I  can't  speak  fluent  Spanish,  but  I'm \n here  to  approve  this  new  feature.  Good \n Spanish.  It's  actually  really  good.  It's \n uh  telling  me  that  you  should  subscribe \n to  the  studio.  So,  this  is  good  for \n Yeah.  Apple  Watch,  too.  This  is  good  for \n I'm  going  to  a  hotel  today.  But  this  is \n the  no-brainer,  right?  No,  I'm  too  much \n of  a  shill  today.  I'll  just  go  straight \n to  the  No,  you  know  this.  I'll  I'll  pick \n this  one.  I'll  pick  this  one  for  the \n hotel  because  it's  probably  at  at  least \n 10,000  mAh.  I  will  not  pick  it  if  it's \n not  10,000  mAh.  It's  exactly  10,000. \n Wow.  It's  crazy  what  Ridge  was  able  to \n do. \n Huh.  Okay,  we're  going  with  the  Ridge \n one.  Ooh,  Ultra  Human.  I  have  wondered \n about  these.  I've  seen  a  bunch  of  ads \n for  them.  So,  my  watch  of  choice  is  the \n OnePlus  Watch  3.  Might  be  a  little \n overlap  with  the  metrics,  but  maybe  this \n is  better  for  sleep  tracking  because  the \n OnePlus  watch  is  so  big.  Well,  I'm  in \n somebody's  AI  right  now.  I  could  really \n do  some  damage,  but  I'm  not  going  to  say \n anything  crazy.  That's  my  accessory \n picks.  The  shades,  the  ultraum  ring  for \n sleep  tracking  when  I  take  the  watch  off \n and  put  it  on  my  charger,  Purel,  and  a \n one-sided  Rubik's  cube. \n Pro,  this  phone  is  everything  to  me. \n Takes  great  photos.  I  just  like  using \n the  stock  lenses.  I  enjoy  the  cameras \n and  photographic  styles  works  pretty \n well  and  sometimes  Daz  Cam  makes  it  onto \n the  app  usage  list.  I  did  just  switch \n phones.  Uh  my  new  phone  now  is  the  Pixel \n 9  Pro.  I  have  it  in  the  Broy  leather \n case.  The  leather  wraps  all  the  way \n around  the  edges.  And  also  when  I  don't \n want  to  have  Mag  Safe,  which  is  rare, \n but  I  can  just  take  it  off  and  just  hold \n this  phone  naked  and  it's  beautiful.  I \n know  a  lot  of  the  people  in  the  studio \n use  iPhones.  I  am  an  Android  user.  For  a \n long  time,  the  integration  for  YouTube \n into  Android  phones  was  way  better  than \n on  Apple  devices.  Uh  for  a  long  time  on \n Apple,  you  couldn't  resize  the  window. \n Um  you  couldn't  like  access  things  as \n easily.  Uh  I  do  use  multitasking  all  the \n time  because  I  do  everything  on  my \n phone.  So  I've  used  Android  for  a  long \n time.  I  do  see  the  benefits  to  iPhone, \n but  for  now,  sticking  with  it.  My  phone. \n Have  you  have  any  of  you  ever  had  a  pet, \n a  dog?  This  dog  is  now  going  on  like  15, \n 16  years  old,  and  you  just  love  it.  And \n everyone  who  comes  over  is  like,  I  love \n your  dog.  And  deep  down,  you  know,  this \n dog  is  is  eating  you  alive.  Um,  that's \n my  iPhone  12  mini.  I  uh  have  not  charged \n it  yet  today.  Um,  it  is  1206.  I  have  40% \n battery  life.  The  battery  is  a  perfect \n health.  I  got  it  swapped  a  little  bit \n ago.  This  thing  just  sucks.  Um,  and  I \n love  it  so  much.  I  did  briefly  have  an \n iPhone  16  Pro  Max,  but  I  found  that \n firstly  that  phone  is  incredibly \n expensive  and  didn't  really  offer  any \n necessary  upgrades  that  I  really  needed \n compared  to  older  iPhones  or  other \n Android  phones.  So,  I  decided  to  give \n the  Nexus  6P  another  try.  This  phone \n goes  harder  than  like  taking  three \n espresso  shots  in  the  morning  on  an \n empty  stomach.  And  trust  me,  I  know  what \n that  feels  like.  The  display  still \n honestly  holds  up  in  2025.  Performance, \n buttery  smooth.  It's  one  of  my  favorite \n phones  of  all  time  and  I  think  it's \n honestly  the  best  Google  phone  that's \n ever  been  made.  I  use  a  Pixel  9  Pro  Fold \n with  my  Touch  Grass  skin  on  it.  Let  me \n get \n the  Yeah,  listen  to  that.  I  wanted  a \n folding  phone  for  a  while.  Uh,  my  first \n one  was  the  Pixel  Fold  1  and  then  I \n upgraded  to  the  OnePlus  open  and  now \n I've  upgraded  to  the  Pixel  9  Pro  Fold.  I \n don't  see  myself  upgrading  anytime  soon \n because  I  really  love  this  phone.  As  a \n Pixel  Watch  user,  it  only  makes  perfect \n sense  that  I  also  use  the  Pixel  6  phone, \n which  also  was  from  our  office.  Um,  but \n I  didn't  steal  it.  I  don't  remember  what \n year  this  came  out,  but  it  works \n perfectly  fine.  I  don't  see  the  point  in \n changing  your  phone  and  your  your \n everything  like  every  year,  every  month. \n I  just  think  that's  silly.  I  think  if  it \n works,  you  should  just  keep  using  it \n until  it  breaks.  And  I  don't  want  to \n jinx  it,  but  it  hasn't  broken  yet.  This \n is  not  This  is  barely  working.  Um  I  like \n to  use  my  phone  my  phones  until  I  can't \n anymore.  I  usually  I  like  to  just  run \n them  into  the  ground.  Um,  and  this  big \n old \n crack  right  there,  that  happened  um  the \n day  after  I  took  the  case  off  of  it. \n Actually,  I  hope  to  upgrade  soon, \n Marquez.  But  yeah,  wow.  It's  mainly  just \n iPhones  and  Google  phones.  Huh.  It  is \n actually,  other  than  the  Samsung.  So, \n there's  a  Samsung  S25  Plus  and  then  it's \n Pixels  and \n iPhones.  Okay.  Sorry,  Miles. \n I  like  small  phones,  but  I  also  have  big \n hands  and  maximize  my  phone  usage.  So, \n I'm  probably  not  going  to  pick  the  tiny \n phone.  There's  there's  a  part  of  me \n that's  still  like  this  is  a  great \n design.  I  would,  as  you \n know,  typically  have  two,  but  I'm  not \n allowed  to  do  that.  So,  I'm  picking  an \n Android  phone  to  go  with  the  Android \n smartwatch.  And  I  pray  that \n compatibility  does  not  become  my  enemy \n because  I  have  a  soft  spot  for  this \n phone.  I'm  going  Pixel  6  Pro.  They  got \n to  bring  back  the  visor.  Why  did  they \n get  rid  Why  did  they  do  this?  Why  did \n they  get  rid  of  the  the  distinct  I  love \n Pixel  9,  but  bring  back  the  visor?  This \n is  my  petition  to  bring  back  the  visor. \n I'm  going  Pixel  6  Pro.  That  is \n crazy. \n Okay,  so  I  feel  like  I'm  judging \n people's  lives  now.  They  really  can't \n live  without  these.  H  That's  tough. \n Okay,  I'm  Yeah,  I'll  go  with  the \n Leatherman  Free  P4  cuz  this  is  an  actual \n real  life  do  everything  multi-tool.  Um, \n it's  rare  that  I  actually  need  like  a \n pair  of  pliers,  but  if  you  do,  the  thing \n that  I  like  best  about  this  system \n though  is  you  can  use  it  one-handed.  The \n other  thing  I  think  the  this  is  the  E3 \n angel  eyes  flashlight  from  Rooron. \n Everyone's  always  like,  \"Why  would  you \n carry  a  flashlight?  You  have  one  in  your \n phone.  Your  phone  flashlight  is  like \n maybe  50  lumens.\"  This  is  700. \n The  most  important  part  of  my  EDC  is  my \n puppy  Zuri. \n This  is  Zaryi.  If  you  know  me,  you  know \n that  I  am  vocal  about  my  origin  from \n Cincinnati.  And  so,  what  better  way  to \n show  that  than  with  Grers's  Ice  Cream. \n But  not  just  any  Grers  Ice  Cream.  This \n is  the  collaboration  between  Grers  and \n Skyline  Chile.  Skyline  Spice  Grater  Ice \n Cream  with  Oyster  Cracker  Cracker  Bits \n in  it. \n It  actually  does  taste  like  chili. \n You  can  take  away  pretty  much  everything \n except  for  my  lacrosse  stick.  I  cannot \n live  without  this  thing  because  exercise \n is  very  important  when  you  work  a \n physical  job.  This  might  take  two  two \n takes.  Two  takes.  I  haven't  done  this  in \n a  while. \n Ready?  Oh,  wait.  Hold  up.  Hold \n up. \n How  this  lands? \n I  could  have  hit  Rich  right \n there.  Oo,  could  have  hit  Eric.  I  found \n something  kind  of  interesting.  So,  this \n is  a  daily  bliss.  This  is  a  new  one.  I \n filled  up  my  old  one.  I'm  just  going  to \n just  show  this  piece  of  paper.  It's  not \n paper  at least  traditionally  sense.  It's \n stone  paper.  It  is  tear  resistant.  It's \n really  hard  to \n tear.  It's  still  flexible.  Holds  ink \n really  well.  Smooth  to  the  touch. \n and  it  writes  really \n well.  So,  it's  great.  That's  like  the \n coolest  writing  accessory  I  ever  have. \n This  pen  is  also  from  CW&T.  And \n now  I  use  these  pens  to  draw  things.  I'm \n working  on  an  interior  redesign  right \n now.  The  last  part  of  this  is  I  also \n keep  this  secondary  thing  for  uh  little \n sticky  notes  and  also  um  pencil \n sharpeners.  So  yeah,  again,  just  in  the \n vein  of  not  having  a  bunch  of  stuff  at \n the  bottom  of  your  bag  just  roaming \n around.  My  Zoom  H1  uh  audio  people.  Oh, \n I  said  I  told  Eric  I'd  put  on  sunscreen \n while  I  do  this.  Yeah,  baby.  This \n thing's  old.  I  got  this  thing  in  high \n school.  Uh  I  specifically  got  it  early \n on  in  high  school  so  that  I  could  record \n audition  tapes. \n I  don't  use  it  at  work  because  it \n doesn't  do  a  lot  of  stuff  that  we  need \n here.  But  if  I'm  just  like  out  and \n about,  I  can  plug  a  binaural  mic  in \n there.  I  can  use  the  internal.  I  just \n like  it  just  gets  it  done  that.  It  runs \n on  one  double  A.  I  have  DJI  mics  which  I \n pretty  much  always  have  in  my  backpack \n cuz  they're  so  small.  But  these  are \n super  useful.  So,  if  anyone  does \n anything  where  they  record  stuff,  this \n little  tiny  thing  can  give  you  a \n reasonable  faximile  of  of  like  a  podcast \n mic  while  you're  on  the \n go.  This \n is  M2  Mac  Pro.  This  is  simply  a  beast  of \n a  computer.  And  the  beauty  of  this \n computer  is  that  it's  running  Apple \n silicon,  which  is  like  this  big.  So,  you \n have  this  massive  tower  with  all  this \n room  inside.  So,  what  are  you  going  to \n do  with  all  that  room  inside?  Well,  you \n do \n this.  So,  this  person  can't  live  without \n the \n snacks  or  or  can't  live  without  the \n computer  or  both.  I  played  lacrosse  for \n a  year.  It  was  only  a  year.  I  I  didn't \n like  getting  hit  that  often. \n Flashlight.  What?  I  need  to  talk  to \n whoever's  this  is.  Yeah,  I'm  I'mma  drop \n this  just  cuz  Yeah,  I  got  hit  too  much. \n I  was  I  have  PTSD  with  this.  Yeah,  I'm \n going  mic  pack  to  go  with  my  R5.  I'm \n going \n flashlight  if  only  for  bragging  rights. \n Can't  live  without  it.  So,  there  you \n have  it.  That  is  my  picks  of  the  best  of \n the  best  of  the  EDC  from  the  studio  this \n year.  This  is  the  perfect  daily  carry, \n but  it's  only  missing  one \n thing.  The  subscribe  button  probably  be \n right  here.  All right,  well  that  about \n does  it.  If  you  want  to  watch  another \n video  that's  similar  to  this,  check  out \n our  desk  setups  video.  Some  good  stuff \n in  there,  too.  See  you  later.",
