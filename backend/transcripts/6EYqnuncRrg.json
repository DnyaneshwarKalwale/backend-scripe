  "transcript": "these  are  the  seven  laws  of  LinkedIn \n that  the  biggest  accounts  use  to \n dominate  the  platform  they're  what  made \n me  the  number  one  female  Creator  on \n LinkedIn  I've  spent  over  $30,000  on \n courses  coaches  and  agency  to  learn \n these  laws  so  listen  closely  because  no \n one  is  talking  about  this  yet  and  it's \n exactly  what  you  need  if  you  want  to  get \n ahead  so  l  number  one  is  to \n strategically  make  fast  connections \n here's  what  I  mean  do  you  ever  feel  like \n LinkedIn  isn't  pushing  your  content  into \n the  algorithm  well  that's  because  you \n need  to  make  more  fast  connections  see \n LinkedIn  unlike  any  other  platform  works \n on  a  connection  to  connection  basis \n there's  first  second  and  third \n connections  first  connections  means \n you're  directly  connected  with  someone \n so  there's  a  mutual  connection  agreement \n here  second  connections  means  that  you \n are  connected  to  their  first  connections \n but  not  directly  connected  and  third \n connections  means  that  you  are  connected \n with  the  second  connection  which  is  the \n furest  of  reach  now  the  interesting \n thing  is  that  whenever  you  post  your \n post  is  initially  shown  to  a  pool  of \n your  fast  connections  only  and  if  your \n fast  connections  engage  with  your  post \n then  LinkedIn  pushes  your  post  to  their \n second  and  third  connections  let  me  show \n you  if  we  go  on  to  the  LinkedIn  feed  you \n can  see  post  from  your  fast  connections \n then  the  only  way  you  see  post  from \n second  or  third  connections  is  if \n someone  in  your  first  connections  liked \n it  it's  the  same  with  your  content  so  to \n maximize  your  chances  of  visibility  you \n need  to  connect  with  people  every  single \n day  to  expand  that  pool  of  active  fast \n connections  most  people  have  had  their \n LinkedIn  for  years  if  not  decades  some \n of  them  may  not  be  active  anymore  and \n some  of  them  may  just  not  be  interested \n in  the  content  that  you're  posting  now \n it  happens  especially  if  you  had \n different  jobs  throughout  your  LinkedIn \n journey  and  have  connected  with  people \n in  those  jobs  now  fixing  this  is \n relatively  easy  all  you  need  to  do  is \n find  active  people  who  fit  into  your \n ideal  audience  to  connect  with  directly \n this  will  flood  your  LinkedIn  with \n active  users  who  are  interested  in  what \n you  have  to  say  giving  you  a  better \n chance  to  bypass  the  LinkedIn  ranking \n system  and  improve  your  visibility  to  do \n this  fast  you  can  use  the  sniper  method \n go  to  an  active  Creator  or  founder  in \n your  Niche  look  at  their  comments  and \n find  people  that  meet  your  connection \n criteria  let's  say  I'm  looking  for \n entrepreneurs  and  CEOs  then  I  quickly \n scam  their  comment  section  then  I  look \n at  their  headlines  where  they  most \n likely  identify  themselves  as  that  then \n I  right  click  on  the  profile  name  so  I \n can  have  the  profile  open  on  a  different \n tab  then  I  do  this  10  to  20  times  then  I \n engage  with  their  content  and  then  send \n them  a  personalized  connection  request \n the  key  here  is  to  keep  it  short  add  a \n unique  sentence  and  end  with  a \n compliment  or  a  reference  to  what  you \n and  them  have  in  common  but  as  LinkedIn \n grows  and  your  ideal  connections  get \n spammed  with  connection  requests  you \n need  to  have  good  content  on  your \n profile  which  leads  me  to  law  number  two \n Master  writing  for  LinkedIn  like  any \n other  social  media  there  is  one \n universal  rule  the  hul  must  grab \n people's  attention  within  the  first  few \n seconds  but  on  LinkedIn  there  is  way \n more  to  it  every  LinkedIn  post  you  to \n make  should  act  as  a  mini  reintroduction \n post  of  who  you  are  and  how  you  help  and \n to  get  the  most  attention  per  second  you \n need  to  provide  all  the  value  up  front  a \n good  text  hook  will  always  start  with \n outlining  a  problem  the  hook  right  here \n does  that  it's  less  than  10  words  and \n it's  straight  to  the  point  then  in \n sentence  two  we  agitate  it  and  add  what \n we  call  a  rehook  this  emphasizes  on  what \n you're  saying  and  makes  people  click  on \n read  more  and  on  sentence  we  then \n provide  a  direct  solution  to  the  problem \n this  way  we  have  half  our  post  already \n written  for  us  and  it  looks  better  than \n 60%  of  LinkedIn  content  that's  filled \n with  busws  paragraphs  and  jagon  but  what \n people  forget  is  that  the  rest  of  the \n post  needs  to  have  the  exact  same  Rhythm \n sentence  by  sentence  line  by  line  you \n should  be  able  to  read  every  single  one \n of  them  on  its  own  to  continue  writing \n we  must  add  Rhythm  to  it  varied  sentence \n lengths  bullet  points  and  most  important \n make  it  sing  not  skip  I  do  this  in  every \n single  line  of  my  own  posts  where  the \n lines  don't  just  speak  they  flow  and  at \n the  end  we  have  a  complimentary  image \n that  ties  it  all  together  use  this  exact \n same  framework  when  you  write  your  next \n LinkedIn  post  you'll  see  a  clear \n difference  in  your  engagement  and \n Clarity  of  the  post  that  you're  writing \n now  the  third  law  to  blow  up  your \n LinkedIn  goes  hand  inand  with  posting \n it's  commenting  and  why  I  love  this  law \n it's  because  it  doesn't  require  you  to \n stick  to  the  post  every  day  three  times \n a  day  ham  will  that  has  been  pushed  by \n us  by  so  many  marketing  experts  over  the \n last  decade  commenting  on  LinkedIn \n doesn't  require  any  writing  Mastery  and \n for  anyone  who's  trying  to  grow  this  is \n the  best  solution  to  do  it  let  me \n explain  on  LinkedIn  you  get  to  post \n maybe  once  or  twice  a  day  and  then  your \n post  gets  pushed  to  the  people  who \n follow  you  and  are  connected  with  you \n and  so  on  but  with  comments  you  can  be \n seen  10  20  and  even  hundreds  of  times \n your  comments  get  seen  by  the  author  and \n Their  audience  so  collectively  if  you \n decide  to  comment  on  10  different \n accounts  every  single  day  and  each \n account  has  around  10,000  followers \n these  followers  will  see  your  comments \n and  if  your  comment  is  good  and  it \n resonates  then  it  will  get  pushed  all \n the  way  to  the  top  as  a  top  comment \n showing  it  to  even  more  people  who  may \n not  follow  you  this  comment  right  here \n got  200  likes  and  two  inbound  leads \n without  even  having  to  post  on  my  main \n profile  and  the  best  part  about \n commenting  is  that  they  don't  have  to  be \n perfect  they  just  need  to  resonate  focus \n on  the  quality  in  your  content  and  go \n for  quantity  in  your  comments  just  don't \n use  AI  to  do  your  comments  please  now  La \n number  four  is  sending  DMS  look  LinkedIn \n is  a  gold  mine  for  lead  generation  in \n growth  and  you  know  this  by  now  but  in \n order  to  get  the  gold  you  need  a  shovel \n and  on  LinkedIn  that's  the  DMS  over  the \n last  decade  they've  been  incredibly \n misuse  pitch  slaps  with  generic \n templates  low  quality  connection  invites \n and  not  to  mention  the  endless  let's \n exchange  change  synergies  or  can  I  pick \n your  brain  type  of  message  this  is \n literally  your  competition  right  now  so \n with  a  little  bit  of  creativity  and  some \n value  to  offer  you  can  actually \n outperform  99%  of  your  competitors  the \n simplest  way  to  get  around  this  is  to \n start  a  conversation  instead  of  sending \n the  typical  hey  let's  exchange  synergies \n or  hey  I  saw  you  do  B2B  I  sell  B2B  to  B \n to  be  people  let's  connect  instead  of \n doing  all  of  that  you  find  Mutual  ground \n now  let's  say  that  I  just  came  back  from \n a  local  conference  in  London  I  see  that \n let's  call  him  Jim  was  there  too  and  he \n would  be  a  great  connection  or  a  lead  my \n first  message  to  him  would  be  like  hey \n Jim  I'm  exhausted  from  business  growth \n event  in  London  I  see  you  were  there  as \n well  did  you  manage  to  grab  some  of  the \n free  snacks  in  the  front  so  what  I'm \n really  doing  here  is  I'm  asking  a \n question  that's  not  intrusive  and  I'm \n also  not  asking  him  to  give  me  his  money \n right  away  it's  a  simple  yes  or  no \n answer  and  it's  also  kind  of  funny  and \n it's  womb  because  we  share  a  mutual \n event  and  usually  and  the  best  part  of \n this  is  that  if  there's  some  interest \n they'll  usually  reply  and  if  they're \n really  not  interested  at  all  then  they \n ghost  right  and  if  they  do  reply  then \n you  can  go  back  and  forth  have  a  casual \n conversation  then  you  can  talk  about \n what  you  guys  do  and  after  a  few \n messages  you  get  onto  the  topic  you \n actually  want  to  discuss  because  then \n you've  earned  the  right  to  ask  there's  a \n logical  progression  in  these \n conversations  you  lead  with  fun  and  and \n end  with  value  instead  of  a  transaction \n now  moving  on  to  law  number  five  is  to \n focus  on  high  quality  images  LinkedIn  is \n a  positioning  game  and  the  quickest  way \n to  gain  Authority  is  via  the  photos  you \n use  this  matters  a  lot  because  how \n people  see  you  is  how  they  perceive  you \n visually  you  need  to  be  showing  your \n reader  that  you  are  worth  listening  to \n by  the  way  you're  presenting  yourself  or \n worth  listening  to  by  the  way  you're \n presenting  your  information  this  photo \n here  screams  rookie  in  fact  fact  this \n single  photo  here  changed  the  entire  way \n I  was  perceived  on  the  platform  it \n repositioned  me  completely  so  the  photos \n you  post  on  LinkedIn  need  to  follow \n these  three  step  criteria  one  they  need \n to  be  up  close  ideally  showing  your  face \n clearly  this  builds  trust  then  secondly \n they  have  to  be  well  lit  high  quality \n and  have  a  good  angle  this  reflects  your \n quality  and  three  ideally  a  reflection \n of  your  brand  on  LinkedIn  they  need  to \n be  clear  bright  and  easy  to  read  and \n have  one  specific  outcome  and  always \n visually  appealing  to  other  the  people's \n Desires  in  this  specific  case  for \n example  it  was  growth  which  was  clearly \n shown  in  various  ways  see  perception  is \n one  of  the  greatest  forces  when  it  comes \n to  building  your  personal  brand  on \n LinkedIn  is  there  a  reason  why  Brands \n such  as  Nike  and  Apple  spend  Millions  on \n visual  branding  because  perception  sells \n not  just  the  copy  of  their  ads  but  also \n the  visuals  that  stop  your  scroll  or \n even  stop  you  in  the  street  and  the \n biggest  way  to  wrap  my  head  around  this \n for  me  was  if  the  person  that  I  love \n following  on  LinkedIn  wouldn't  post  this \n then  why  would  I  and  if  I  can't  post \n stuff  like  they  do  just  yet  then  how  can \n I  start  and  this  whole  positioning  game \n on  LinkedIn  with  visual  leads  me \n perfectly  into  today's  sponsor  Fiverr \n which  I  hold  deeply  in  my  heart  as  it's \n one  of  the  first  platforms  I've  ever  use \n to  get  gigs  and  where  I've  hired \n Freelancers  for  a  wide  range  of  projects \n including  some  logo  design  my  first  logo \n for  the  agency  was  actually  a  one-day \n idea  executed  by  fivers  amazing \n Freelancers  and  if  I  was  trying  to  make \n a  visual  impact  on  LinkedIn  I'd  go  and \n find  someone  like  Lucy  here  who's  local \n to  me  and  available  within  the  next  week \n to  hire  her  for  a  day  or  two  to  take \n some  photos  or  if  I  was  you  and  I  was \n starting  from  zero  I'd  go  for  someone \n like  Solon  here  who's  got  amazing \n reviews  and  I'll  get  him  to  create  some \n amazing  social  media  carousels  or \n infographic  templates  that  I  could  use \n for  my  LinkedIn  or  Twitter  and  even \n Instagram  if  I  wanted  to  I've  turned  to \n fivera  for  years  it's  so  easy  to  search \n filter  and  hire  talented  Freelancers  on \n your  own  time  and  the  communication  on \n the  platform  is  always  seamless  it's \n fast  and  it's  effective  there's  a \n limitless  amount  of  things  that  you  can \n accomplish  with  Fiverr  and  honestly  my \n first  logo  is  what's  gotten  me  here  in \n front  of  you  today  so  if  you  want  to \n find  skilled  Freelancers  providing \n services  in  graphic  design  marketing  and \n so  much  more  visit  f.  c/a  and  use  promo \n code  Lara  for  10%  off  for  your  first \n order  now  law  number  six  is  pinned \n comments  these  are  comments  you  leave \n under  your  own  post  but  automatically \n get  ranked  as  top  comment  because  you \n are  the  author  here  you  have  a  golden \n opportunity  to  drive  traffic  to  an  offer \n a  new  product  or  even  an  event  that \n you're  hosting  because  again  you  can \n only  post  once  or  twice  a  day  but  you \n can  always  comment  more  and  I  want  you \n to  listen  to  this  tip  closely  because \n posting  about  your  your  offer  won't  get \n you  the  results  that  you  want  but \n commenting  about  it  on  the  every  single \n one  of  your  posts  will  so  instead  of \n crowding  your  post  with  a  long  CTA  that \n ruins  the  flow  of  your  post  and  makes  it \n sound  salesy  you  can  always  leave  it  as \n a  pin  comment  underneath  every  single \n one  of  your  posts  this  hack  in  fact  made \n me  $10,000  last  year  from  plugging  my \n linking  Playbook  I  was  selling  I  never \n posted  about  it  I  only  commenting  about \n it  existing  what  I  did  here  was  I  built \n trust  bya  the  value  on  that  post  then  I \n converted  it  via  the  pin  comment  leading \n people  to  my  paid  resource  this  is \n extremely  underrated  because  if  you \n think  about  it  people  who  are  looking  at \n your  comments  are  already  at  a  higher \n interest  level  than  your  typical  cold \n follower  meaning  that  the  traffic  and \n conversion  to  those  comments  is  higher \n now  the  last  and  final  law  is  to  stop \n scheduling  your  content  on  LinkedIn  I \n can  literally  come  with  my  hand  the \n amount  of  times  I've  scheduled  content \n this  year  the  reason  it  decreases  your \n Reach  This  is  a  proven  fact  see  posting \n is  like  a  snowball  starts  small  but  the \n more  you  push  it  forward  the  bigger  it \n gets  and  the  faster  it  moves  and  most \n people  are  killing  it  before  it  gets \n going  because  they're  scheduling  their \n content  and  they  kill  their  momentum \n last  year  I  tested  this  Theory  and  my \n engagement  will  drop  by  10%  look  the \n reality  is  that  scheduling  tools  are  an \n extra  layer  of  automation  that  LinkedIn \n can  detect  and  even  if  we  assume  this \n isn't  true  Let's  Pretend  This  doesn't \n happen  it's  never  happen  to  me  every \n time  I  schedule  content  it's  fine  right \n but  when  you  schedule  your  own  content \n you're  actually  gearing  yourself  to \n forget  about  it  because  that's  pretty \n much  the  goal  when  scheduling  your \n content  it's  almost  like  a  set  and \n forget  right  you're  scheduling  your \n content  to  get  ahead  and  when  you're  at \n work  you  don't  actually  want  to  you  know \n think  about  posting  and  you  don't  even \n want  to  be  on  the  platform  but  like  I \n mentioned  earlier  commenting  is  crucial \n in  this  LinkedIn  growth  game  especially \n during  that  first  hour  your  post  is \n being  rolled  out  during  my  come  up  on \n LinkedIn  I  religiously  blocked  my  time \n on  my  calendar  from  12:  to  1:30  p.m.  my \n posting  time  was  12:30  and  during  the  30 \n minutes  before  I'd  warm  up  my  feet  by \n leaving  comments  on  other  people's  posts \n and  naturally  due  to  the  law  of \n reciprocity  you're  getting  up  people  to \n come  check  out  your  profile  and  also \n leave  a  comment  back  this  just  happens \n natural  because  we're  humans  then  at \n 12:30  I  drop  my  post  and  reply  to  every \n single  comment  I  get  within  the  first \n hour  now  obviously  depending  on  the \n success  of  my  post  I  start  replying  to \n every  single  comment  in  that  same  hour \n or  if  I  didn't  have  that  much  engagement \n to  fill  up  that  allocated  time  I'd  go  on \n my  feed  and  engage  with  more  people  who \n posted  within  that  time  this  exact  same \n routine  is  the  snow  for  your  snowball  to \n get  bigger  and  ultimately  gain  more \n momentum  to  get  bigger  and  there  we  go \n those  are  the  seven  laws  you  need  to \n know  to  grow  your  LinkedIn  at  Rocket \n speed  apply  these  over  the  next  6  months \n and  watch  yourself  get  ahead  of  everyone \n else  and  if  you  want  an  in-depth \n strategy  to  writing  and  posting  on \n LinkedIn  make  sure  you  watch  this  video \n right  here  where  I  cover  exactly  what \n you  need  to  know  to  write  about  and  how \n remember  my  friends  the  devil  is  in  the \n detail  so  I  hope  you  took  some  notes  see \n you  in  the  next  one  bye",
