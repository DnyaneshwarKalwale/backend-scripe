  "transcript": "what  if  I  told  you  you  could  be  making \n thousands  of  dollars  from  your  college \n kitchen  with  no  experience  industry \n connections  or  a  degree  well  that's \n exactly  what  happened  to  me  I  hit  my \n first  $110,000  month  sitting  in  my \n college  room  with  a  broken  chair  and  no \n idea  how  to  write  the  perfect  CV  and  in \n this  video  I'm  going  to  show  you  the \n three  steps  you  can  take  to  making  $900 \n in  30  minutes  just  by  writing  content  on \n LinkedIn  and  get  people  paying  you  money \n for  it  and  instead  of  teaching  you  how \n to  start  a  Drop  Shipping  Store  Amazon \n FBA  or  even  affiliate  marketing  just \n like  those  videos  on  Tik  Tok  are  telling \n you  to  I'm  going  to  save  you  the \n thousands  of  hours  and  dollars  I  spent \n trying  all  of  these  business  models  that \n never  actually  worked  for  me  and  show \n you  how  to  write  content  on  LinkedIn  and \n get  people  paying  you  money  for  it  even \n if  it  took  you  30  minutes  to  write  the \n first  thing  you  want  to  know  is  what \n writing  content  on  LinkedIn  even  is  so \n let  me  explain  when  you  scroll  on  social \n media  you'll  often  see  post  by  popular \n CEOs  Founders  and  even  influencers  that \n are  getting  thousands  of  likes  and \n comments  every  single  day  the  truth  is \n the  majority  of  these  people  aren't \n frightening  their  content  themselves \n and  this  is  the  one  thing  that  is  making \n complete  beginners  like  you  and  me  money \n this  secret  thing  is  called  ghost \n writing  which  is  basically  the  act  of \n writing  for  someone  else  today  attention \n is  a  new  currency  and  people  are  willing \n to  pay  for  it  and  like  I  said  these \n people  want  thousands  of  followers  and \n likes  as  they  usually  lead  to  more \n Authority  reputation  and  money  but  they \n just  don't  have  the  time  or  skill  to \n write  for  themselves  and  here's  where \n you  come  in  as  a  freelance  Ghost  Writer \n where  you're  pretending  to  be  these \n people  on  their  behalf  writing  content \n and  and  growing  their  brand  as  our \n result  and  the  best  place  to  start  doing \n this  is  LinkedIn  where  I  honestly  see \n the  most  opportunity  right  now  it's  a \n gold  mine  for  growth  and  conversions  and \n again  unlike  all  other  beginner  business \n models  freelance  ghost  writing  is \n literally  the  easiest  one  you  don't  need \n to  put  your  own  money  up  front  to  start \n it's  in  high  demand  and  it  can  pay  for \n currently  this  means  on  a  month-to-month \n basis  realistically  almost  every  single \n dollar  you  make  is  profit  the  majority \n of  your  expenses  will  go  to  software \n tools  but  that's  pretty  pretty  much  it \n and  here's  literally  what  you  need  to  do \n to  get  started  the  first  step  you  need \n to  take  is  start  posting  your  own \n content  on  LinkedIn  look  you  don't  need \n any  experience  or  a  CV  to  get  hired  to \n ghost  right  but  you  don't  need  proof  of \n work  and  the  best  way  to  show  it  is  by \n posting  online  people  are  getting  tired \n of  hiring  people  without  knowing  if  they \n can  actually  do  the  job  so  save  them \n time  and  show  them  by  writing  and \n posting  your  own  content  on  LinkedIn  so \n let  me  break  down  the  strategy  that  I \n use  to  grow  my  LinkedIn  and  landed \n clients  at  the  beginning  which  you  can \n also  use  for  your  clients  too  by  the  way \n pick  your  content  pillars  this  could  be \n ghost  writing  writing  and  storytelling \n build  a  posting  calendar  at  a  minimum \n you  should  be  posting  three  times  a  week \n on  LinkedIn  at  the  same  time  every \n single  time  this  builds  Cadence  momentum \n and  memorability  practice  and  understand \n patterns  the  more  you  write  the  better \n you'll  get  a  writing  your  first  post \n will  suck  and  so  will  your  50th  but  by \n the  time  you  comeone  past  it  learn  how \n to  use  a  hook  write  the  body  and \n understand  calls  to  action  you're  in  see \n in  this  video  I'm  not  going  to  get  into \n the  trenches  of  how  to  master  writing \n because  quite  frankly  I  didn't  know  a \n thing  when  I  started  till  this  day  I've \n not  read  a  single  copywriting  book  you \n know  what  I  did  though  I  learned  how  to \n recognize  patterns  and  if  you're  an \n employed  and  broke  just  like  I  was \n there's  one  thing  you  have  right  now \n time  time  to  spend  on  LinkedIn  scrolling \n and  looking  for  top  performing  content \n that  is  working  across  the  platform  you \n can  find  this  by  turning  your  doom \n scrolling  on  Instagram  and  Tik  Tok  to \n conscious  consumption  by  scrolling  on \n LinkedIn  and  identifying  these  patterns \n look  for  viral  content  look  for  Content \n that  you  personally  enjoy  look  for \n Content  that  is  is  getting  interesting \n comments  people  have  done  the  work  for \n you  all  you  need  to  do  is  notice  it \n understand  the  hooks  they  use  understand \n the  formatting  they  used  and  understand \n the  topic  or  even  the  template  they  used \n work  smart  not  hard  then  take  everything \n you  learned  and  apply  it  to  your  own \n content  if  you  learn  how  to  identify \n these  patterns  and  work  with  clients  in \n niches  that  you're  already  familiar  with \n 12  pieces  of  content  can  take  you  30 \n minutes  you  can  also  use  my  free \n templates  which  have  helped  people  just \n like  you  write  quicker  and  better  them \n for  the  clients  and  if  you  want  me  to \n keep  on  making  free  resources  just  like \n this  one  please  make  sure  you  subscribe \n to  my  Channel  please  okay  now  the  second \n step  is  getting  a  client  there's  two \n ways  you  can  do  this  inbound  and \n outbound  to  get  your  first  outbound \n client  you  need  three  things  a \n good-looking  LinkedIn  profile  and  in \n case  you  haven't  seen  it  I  showed  you \n how  to  optimize  your  profile  in  one  of \n my  past  videos  I'll  link  it  somewhere \n around  the  screen  the  next  thing  is  a \n simple  offer  where  you  focus  on  one \n problem  and  one  solution  for  example  I \n turn  a  60-minute  call  into  30  pieces  of \n content  don't  go  too  crazy  with  your \n offer  and  show  yourself  as  a  case  study \n to  validate  your  offer  the  next  thing \n and  lastly  patience  and  honestly  some \n guts  most  videos  go  into  a  lot  of  detail \n for  beginners  on  the  perfect  outbound \n system  crms  blah  blah  blah  no  if  you're \n looking  to  learn  your  first  couple \n clients  literally  don't  worry  about  that \n right  now  make  a  list  of  100  people  that \n you'd  like  to  work  with  that  may  benefit \n from  your  ghost  writing  and  DM  every \n single  one  of  them  here's  a  short \n template  that  I've  used  in  the  past  that \n people  used  on  me  as  well  that  works \n every  single  time  when  adopted  well  hi \n name  I  recently  watched  your  podcast \n with  name  and  was  incredibly  inspired  by \n thing  you  said  I  personally  have \n benefited  from  your  advice  already  and \n wanted  to  thank  you  I'm  a  LinkedIn  ghost \n writer  and  see  a  lot  of  potential  for \n your  brand  to  grow  on  LinkedIn  I've \n taken  some  inspiration  from  what  you \n said  in  podcast  and  wrote  five  po \n showing  you  how  I  could  write  your \n content  in  your  tone  of  voice  with \n almost  no  work  on  your  side  let  me  know \n if  I  could  share  a  free  personalized \n video  on  how  we  could  work  together \n thanks  name  this  without  a  doubt  will \n work  for  you  if  you  personalize  it  well \n the  conversation  is  genuine  and  you \n follow  up  too  most  of  the  time  your \n ideal  client  may  see  this  DM  but  they'll \n forget  to  reply  so  make  sure  that  if  you \n didn't  get  a  yes  or  a  no  follow  up  with \n a  hey  I  know  you're  busy  I  truly  believe \n I  could  help  you  do  amazing  thing  you \n think  they  want  to  achieve  on  LinkedIn  I \n have  the  content  ready  to  send  so  just \n need  your  permission  again  this  is  Mega \n powerful  you're  touching  on  a  potential \n problem  they  have  you're  solving  it  and \n and  you're  doing  it  for  free  for  them \n this  works  because  you're  using  the \n basic  principles  of  persuasion  here \n social  proof  reciprocity  bias  and  liking \n once  they  reply  with  a  yes  and  only  then \n create  the  post  that  you've  offered  and \n the  loom  to  accompany  them  so  you  don't \n waste  your  time  making  millions  of  them \n if  you  do  this  enough  times  you'll  get \n at  least  two  yeses  and  if  you're  a \n beginner  you  can  charge  between  $500  and \n $1,000  per  month  for  writing  12  pieces \n of  content  this  is  three  posts  a  week \n easy  and  before  you  get  nervous  no  you \n don't  need  expert  experience  in  N  niches \n sure  it  helps  but  it's  not  100%

does  sound  kind  of  cool  but \n that's  besides  the  point  the  content \n you'll  be  writing  about  is  not \n necessarily  about  your  clients  or  their \n office  it's  about  the  benefits  that \n they're  able  to  provide  to  Their \n audience  however  if  you're  good  at \n productivity  because  you're  so  good  at \n managing  your  time  with  different  things \n
