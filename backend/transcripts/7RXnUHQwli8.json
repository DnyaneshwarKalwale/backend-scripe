I  don't  wear  jewelry,  with  this  it \n doesn't  suit  me.  No,  I  would  put  a  ring  on  it.  It \n seems  to  me  that  if  you  don't  dress  phenomenally,  you \n 're  gorgeous,  and  the  makeup  is \n subtle,  and  I  liked  your  hair. \n [Music] [ \n Applause] [ \n Music] \n [Applause] [Music] [Music] \n  \n  \n rendar  rad  rar \n [Music] \n aujourd'hui \n [Music] \n [Music] \n for \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n [Music] \n nice  you.
