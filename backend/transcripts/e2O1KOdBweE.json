  "transcript": "B2B  marketing  is  changing  a  lot  in  2025 \n and  in  this  video  I'm  going  to  present \n the  five  B2B  trends  that  are  happening \n right  now  and  that  you  can  use  in  order \n to  grow  your  business  so  in  the  past \n year  B2B  marketing  changed  a  lot  gen  AI \n popped  out  of  nowhere  and  completely \n transform  marketing  and  content \n marketing  also  now  B2B  buyers  prefer  to \n go  on  a  self  serve  buying  mode  so \n basically  they  prefer  to  research \n information  before  talking  to  a  sales \n representative  and  I  also  noticed  that \n the  budgets  of  marketing  companies  have \n reduced  so  this  is  the  context  and  based \n on  this  context  I  analyzed  five \n marketing  trends  that  you  can  reuse \n right  now  let's  jump  into  Trend  number \n one  which  is  still  Niche  but  very \n interesting  for  your  business  right  now \n B2B  Vlogs  are  getting  more  and  more \n interesting  for  the  audience  so  a  B2B \n Vlog  is  a  new  way  to  connect  with  your \n audience  so  what  you're  going  to  do  is \n to  record  the  behind  the  sces  of  your \n business  to  explain  your  vision  but  also \n to  build  in  public  to  share  your \n expertise  to  show  the  results  that  you \n get  for  your  clients  and  also  to  include \n some  call  to  actions  to  upsell  to  your \n offer  so  here  is  an  example  of  a  B2B \n Vlog  here  is  another  example  and  here  is \n another  example  as  you  can  see  it's \n really  about  the  behind  the  scenes  and \n also  as  you  can  see  here  the  search \n volume  is  getting  higher  and  higher  so \n this  is  an  opportunity  for  you  to  reach \n your  audience  on  YouTube  but  also \n LinkedIn  or  on  your  newsletter  so  build \n in  public  and  use  Vlogs  for  that  second \n trend  is  not  a  big  news  you've  seen  it \n in  the  past  few  years  there  are  more  and \n more  Freelancers  and  solopreneurs  and \n this  becomes  an  entire  new  category  in \n my  opinion  so  you  have  b2c  business  to \n clients  you  have  B2B  business  to \n businesses  and  now  there  is  a  new  one \n that  I  call  b2s  business  to  solopreneurs \n why  it's  slightly  different  than  B2B \n because  as  we  are  just  one  person  we  can \n decide  faster  so  it's  more  based  on \n emotions  and  it's  also  linked  to  their \n personal  life  because  when  you  are  a \n solopreneur  the  line  between  your \n professional  life  and  your  personal  life \n is  getting  thinner  because  most  of  the \n time  you  work  from  home  you  manage  your \n own  agenda  and  also  you  can  take  time \n off  whenever  you  want  so  when  you  are \n working  in  the  b2s  environment  it  feels \n like  selling  to  a  business  because  they \n are  expecting  return  on  investment \n because  their  goal  is  to  make  more  money \n at  the  end  of  the  day  or  to  save  time \n which  is  linked  to  saving  money  or  to \n getting  more  money  but  at  the  same  time \n it  feels  like  b2c  because  you  are \n talking  directly  to  one  person  with \n emotions  so  you  are  also  addressing  the \n emotions  the  objectives  and  the  pains \n inside  your  marketing  so  it's  a  mix  of \n both  you  have  the  AI  part  of  B2B  and  you \n have  the  emotional  side  of  b2c  so  if  you \n are  in  this  industry  or  if  you  want  to \n sell  more  to  Sor  preneurs  you  should \n take  this  into  consideration  and  as  you \n can  see  on  this  graph  there  are  more \n more  and  more  Freelancers  and \n solopreneurs  in  the  US  and  everywhere  in \n the  world  so  it's  a  growing  industry  so \n you  should  include  this  target  audience \n in  your  strategy  if  it  makes  sense  for \n you  here  is  a  third  Trend  that  you  might \n have  noticed  as  well  is  the  no  code  plus \n the  AI  that  help  entrepreneurs  to  build \n content  and  also  most  importantly \n products  very  fast  so  if  you  wanted  to \n build  a  business  in  2015  you  had  to  go \n into  a  development  mode  for  at  least  3 \n to  6  months  to  build  a  software  and  then \n to  include  the  audience  to  build  it  with \n you  and  then  to  release  this  software \n but  now  you  can  build  with  AI  agents \n with  a  no  Cod  platform  and  with  AI \n overall  you  can  build  a  platform  in  two \n weeks  so  it  creates  an  ecosystem  where \n it's  very  easy  to  build  a  software  and \n where  you  can  enter  a  market  very  fast \n so  what  happens  here  is  that  there  is \n more  competition  in  the  product  side \n because  it's  easier  to  build  a  product \n so  there  are  more  of  them  but  because \n there  is  more  competition  on  the  product \n side  there  is  also  more  competition  on \n the  marketing  and  audience  side  and  this \n is  what  you  need  to  understand  from  this \n trend  is  that  of  course  it's  easier  now \n to  build  a  product  but  it's  harder  to \n build  an  audience  a  community  and  to \n find  the  first  100  customers  because \n there  is  more  competition  on  the  product \n side  there  is  also  more  competition  on \n the  audience  sit  so  if  you  want  to  build \n a  software  or  if  you  want  to  build  a \n product  you  need  also  to  to  make  sure \n that  you  build  an  audience  or  that  at \n least  you  have  a  marketing  strategy  to \n find  your  first  100  clients  Trend  number \n four  in  B2B  marketing  right  now  is  that \n every  B2B  businesses  are  trying  to  find \n what  we  call  intent  signals  so  in  order \n to  explain  intent  signals  I  will  give \n you  an  example  imagine  you  are  a  B2B \n business  and  you've  been  creating \n content  for  the  past  3  months  on \n LinkedIn  on  YouTube  and  in  a  newsletter \n you  probably  generated  opportunities  so \n prospects  that  are  interested  to  work \n with  you  but  it  doesn't  mean  that  those \n people  those  businesses  contact  you \n directly  so  now  the  question  is  how  are \n you  going  to  know  who  to  contact  First \n in  order  to  send  emails  or  social  DMS  to \n the  right  people  first  in  priority \n instead  of  called  audiences  that  are  not \n interested  to  work  with  you  so  this  is \n where  Inn  signals  come  in  intern  signals \n will  help  you  to  identify  who  is \n interested  to  work  with  you  based  on \n signals  that  are  available  in  the  market \n for  example  if  one  of  those  suspects \n have  downloaded  10  of  your  ebooks \n forwarded  all  your  emails  and \n participated  to  some  webinars  this  shows \n that  they  have  more  chance  to  convert \n compared  to  someone  who  has  just  liked \n your  LinkedIn  post  just  one  time  so  you \n see  here  it's  all  about  identifying  the \n right  intern  signals  to  spot  them  and  to \n organize  your  CRM  in  order  to  know  who \n to  contact  first  I  noticed  that  Appollo \n is  doing  this  Zoom  info  lead  pipe  or  air \n B2B  and  I  believe  it's  still  a  huge \n Market  and  that  more  and  more  businesses \n will  get  interested  about  int  signals \n this  year  Trend  number  five  which  is \n probably  the  most  exciting  for  most  of \n you  is  the  personal  brand  growth \n personal  brands  are  now  a  central  part \n of  marketing  strategies  this  trend \n really  took  off  in  2022  and  then \n expanding  in  2023  and  2024  now  the \n market  is  getting  more  mature  because \n there  are  more  courses  about  how  to \n build  your  personal  brand  so  there  is \n more  competition  but  still  it's  still  a \n great  marketing  strategy  to  build  your \n personal  brand  so  what  does  it  mean  to \n have  a  personal  brand  overall  so  in  a \n B2B  context  here  is  how  to  build  your \n personal  brand  first  you  need  to  have  a \n specific  expertise  with  track  record  in \n order  to  have  things  to  say  the  second \n thing  is  you  need  to  be  okay  to  talk \n about  your  personality  your  backstory \n and  who  you  are  third  you  need  to  create \n content  on  social  media  such  as  on \n LinkedIn  on  YouTube  or  in  the  newsletter \n and  then  you  need  to  be  consistent  about \n this  expertise  this  story  and  this \n content  so  keep  publishing  over  and  over \n and  then  you  will  build  what  we  call  a \n positioning  on  this  expertise  so  people \n will  associate  your  name  with  the \n expertise  so  if  I  had  to  summarize  a \n personal  brand  is  just  this  mechanism \n about  perception  how  people  perceive  you \n is  your  personal  brain  so  if  I  talk  over \n and  over  about  web  3  I  will  be  perceived \n as  Mr  or  Mrs  web3  if  I  talk  over  and \n over  about  B2B  content  marketing  for \n early  stage  businesses  which  is  my  case \n I  will  be  perceived  as  Mr  B2B  content \n marketing  so  this  is  really  the  role  of \n your  personal  brand  is  to  be  positioned \n on  one  topic  now  be  careful  you  should \n not  try  to  go  viral  or  to  share  too  many \n personal  stories  in  a  B2B  context  what \n matters  most  is  to  build  Authority  so \n you  need  to  have  an  expertise  and  talk \n about  this  expertise  and  as  you  can  see \n on  this  graph  from  Google  Trends  the \n keyword  personal  brand  or  personal \n branding  is  growing  a  lot  because \n everyone  is  getting  interested  and  this \n is  linked  to  the  trend  number  two  which \n is  the  growth  of  solo  pruners  and \n Freelancers  because  they  don't  have  a \n company  they  will  not  build  a  company \n brand  they  will  build  a  personal  brand \n instead  so  the  growth  of  the  interest  of \n personal  Brands  is  just  a  byproduct  of \n the  growth  of  the  solopreneur  and \n freelancer  markets  if  you  want  an  entire \n video  about  how  to  build  your  personal \n brand  tell  me  in  the  comments  and  I  will \n make  sure  to  create  a  video  about  all \n right  that's  the  five  trends  that  will \n have  a  strong  impact  on  B2B  marketing \n this  year  I  hope  it  gives  you  some \n inspiration  to  update  your  strategy  or \n even  to  launch  a  new  product  or  a  new \n business  make  sure  to  like  this  video \n And  subscribe  to  the  channel  if  you  want \n to  get  more  information  and  insights  on \n B2B  marketing  and  I  will  see  you  in  the \n next  video",
