  "transcript": "This  is  the  Nothing  CMF  Phone  2  Pro.  And \n in  a  very  weird  kind  of  way,  this  is  the \n phone  that  I've  been  most  excited  about \n in  2025  because  if  you  remember  the  CMF \n phone  1  from  last  year,  that  thing  came \n out  of  nowhere,  introduced  an  entirely \n new  ecosystem  of  accessories  that  you \n could  very  literally  screw  into  the \n device,  was  an  actually  amazing  phone, \n even  outside  of  those  accessories,  and \n was  only  priced  at  $200  or  $250.  It  was \n so  good  that  I  ended  up  awarding  the \n thing  budget  phone  of  the  year.  And  now \n we  have  the  sequel.  It's  a  little  bit \n more  expensive  at  £219,  but  it's \n claiming  to  be  able  to  do  so  much  more. \n But  if  it  actually  pulls  it  off,  this  is \n going  to  become  like  the  most  instantly \n recommendable  phone  on  the  planet.  So, \n this  is  the  box  I  got.  There's  a  whole \n truckload  of  stuff  inside.  So,  let's \n just  get  rid  of  that  and  let's  start \n with  a  new  wallet  and \n stand.  Well,  that's  already  pretty \n interesting  that  they've  managed  to \n combine  both  of  those  things.  There's \n another  new  accessory  here. \n Interchangeable  lenses.  Well,  that's \n interesting.  Let  me  take  you  back  to  the \n last  video  a  second.  My  mind  is  kind  of \n wearing  of  the  possibilities.  Like,  I'm \n just  thinking  as  an  example.  What  if  you \n use  this  screw  and  this  screw  to  add  a \n permanent  lens  attachment  to  your \n cameras  and  now  they're  a  real  thing? \n Oh,  the  universal  cover,  which,  as \n you'll  see,  works  quite  differently  to \n how  it  used \n to  feel  all  that  premium.  It's  a  little \n flimsy.  There's  a  lanyard.  This  looks \n like  the  same  as  the  one  you  got  with \n the  last  phone.  Why  is  it  so  thick, \n though?  Feels  like  you  could  tow  a  car \n with  this  thing.  And  then  two  new \n earphones.  So,  these  are  the  Buds  2, \n which  look  like  a  very  basic  pair  of  39 \n lb  wireless \n earphones,  and  they  feel  about  as \n plasticky  as  you'd  expect  them  to.  But, \n I've  tested  these  and  I  was  not  ready \n for  how  damn  good  they  sound.  Like,  very \n explosive,  very  bassy,  but  still  clear \n audio.  The  active  noise  cancellation  is \n not  the  best,  but  they  have  all  the  key \n features  like  auto  pause  when  you  take \n one  out  and  pretty  responsive  controls \n up  here.  I  would  actually  go  as  far  as \n to  give  them  a  9.5  out  of  10.  And  then \n also  the  Buds  2  Plus,  which  are  10  pound \n more  at \n 49.  And  they  are  basically  just  a  little \n bit  better  at  everything.  They  have  this \n smoother  texture.  This  little  dimple  is \n made  of  metal  now.  They  have  slightly \n better  sound.  They  have  slightly  more \n noise  cancellation.  But  the  standout \n thing  has  to  be  that  the  battery  life  is \n up  to  61  and  1/2  hours,  which  is  very \n much  up  there.  Also  a  9.5.  You  can't \n really  go  wrong  with  either.  All  right. \n So,  that's  the  accessories.  Now,  we  just \n need  something  to  accessorize.  So,  these \n are  the  CMF  Phone  2  Pros.  We  got  three \n of  the  four  colors.  Let's  just  go  for \n orange.  So,  first  thing  you  see  is  the \n insert,  which  does  actually  contain  a \n case.  Why  are  budget  phones  always  the \n most  generous?  So  then  the  phone  and  at \n the  very  bottom  this  blocky  CMF  styled \n USBC  to  C \n cable  and  the  also  custom  oh  my  god \n seriously  cmfstyled  SIM  ejector  tool  all \n leading  to  this  one \n [Music] \n peel.  So  what  has  actually  changed  since \n the  first  phone?  Well,  if  we  hold  the \n phone  2  Pro  side  by  side  with  the  phone \n one,  I  mean,  there's  a  whole  extra  third \n camera,  there's  a  very  unique  feeling \n button  on  the  side  that  they're  calling \n the  essential  key.  And  just  generally, \n the  body  of  the  phone  is  a  little  bit \n more  refined,  kind  of  like  the  phone  one \n just  went  to  the  gym.  It's  about  5% \n thinner.  It's  about  5%  lighter,  and  it's \n a  little  curvier,  so  it  doesn't  dig  into \n your  hands  as  much.  One  weird  thing  is \n that  there  are  slightly  different \n finishes  depending  on  the  color  that  you \n pick.  Like  they're  saying  that  the  green \n and  the  black  are  meant  to  look \n glass-like.  But  in  person,  I  actually \n don't  like  them  because  it's  not  glass. \n And  in  trying  to  fake  glass  just  feels \n more  like  every  other  budget  phone  out \n there.  So,  let's  get  rid  of  these  and  we \n will  stick  to  the  orange  cuz  I  think \n they've  done  a  better  job  here. \n Oh,  no.  No.  It  looks  okay  actually. \n Well,  there  you  go.  That's  our \n durability  tester.  Anyway,  long  story \n short,  pick  the  orange.  Looks  better.  It \n feels  better.  But  here's  my  big \n question.  How  does  this  fit  in  with  all \n of  this?  Well,  I  got  good  news  and  I  got \n bad  news.  Let's  go  the  way  that  I  want \n it.  Bad  news  first.  So,  the  way  that  the \n phone  one  worked  is  the  entire  back  and \n sides  were  completely  replaceable.  You \n would  take  these  four  screws  and  this \n spinny  thing  out  and  the  whole  thing \n would  just  pop  off  as  one  piece.  And \n then  for  each  accessory,  you  could \n secure  them  directly  onto  the  back  of \n the  phone  using  those  same  few  screws. \n But  it's  a  little  different  now.  You've \n still  got  the  screws,  but  the  back  plate \n is  actually  glued  onto  the  phone  now. \n So,  even  if  you  took  all  the  screws  out, \n nothing  comes  off,  which  is  what's \n allowed  them  to  make  the  phone  slimmer. \n It's  what's  allowed  them  to  improve  the \n IP  rating  from  IP52  to  IP54,  which  means \n it's  protected  from  splashing  water  from \n any  direction  as  opposed  to  water  from \n specific  angles.  But  it  also  means  that \n you're  losing  one  of  the  key  pieces  of \n DNA  that  I  think  made  the  original  so \n special,  which  is  that  you  damaged  the \n back  or  the  sides  of  the  last  phone.  Who \n cares?  you  swap  the  entire  thing  out  for \n £29,  which  meant  that  you  could  happily \n use  this  phone  completely  naked, \n guilt-free.  Whereas,  because  this  is  now \n stuck  on,  we're  right  back  to  where  we \n are  with  just  about  every  other  phone, \n which  is,  well,  I  should  probably  use  a \n case  now.  But  then,  doesn't  that  kind  of \n defeat  the  purpose  of  the  thinness \n improvements?  Plus,  you  might  not  get \n much  choice  when  it  comes  to  the  case. \n Because  while  it  is  very  cool  that  we \n now  have  interchangeable  camera  lenses \n and  this  magnetic  wallet  stand  thing,  if \n you  want  to  use  them,  you  need  this \n case.  This  universal  cover  is  the  only \n way  to  get  the  mount  that  you  need  to \n attach  the  lenses  into.  And  this  is  what \n has  the  magnets  inside  to  be  able  to \n snap  the  wallet  onto.  So,  this  would  be \n its  own  thing  that  you're  also  going  to \n have  to  buy.  And  to  install  it,  you  got \n to  undo  the  screws  on  the  back.  You  got \n to  place  this  on  top  of  your  phone's \n back  plate.  and  then  you  redo  all  the \n screws  on  top  of  it.  The  point  I'm \n getting  to  is  that  if  you're  planning  on \n using  any  of  these  new  accessories, \n which  feels  not  unlikely  if  you're \n choosing  a  phone  like  this,  then  you're \n not  going  to  keep  unscrewing  and \n res-crewing  this  whole  cover.  You're \n just  going  to  keep  it  on.  And  so  what \n that  means  is  that  you've  now  paid  extra \n to  make  your  phone  thicker  than  the \n previous  device.  Also,  not  to  pile  on, \n but  I  don't  even  think  this  magnetic \n wallet  stand  thing  is  worth  all  that.  As \n far  as  it  being  a  wallet,  it  stores, \n they're  saying  three  cards.  I  wouldn't \n feel  comfortable  putting  more  than  two \n in  there.  And  as  a  phone  stand,  I  felt \n like  I've  been  spoiled  by  my  Taurus \n case.  This  stand  has  every  orientation \n and  every  tilt  level  baked  into  it.  The \n CMF  stand  is  it's  just  a  stand.  So, \n that's  the  bad  news.  The  good  news  is \n that  because  the  CMF  Phone  2  Pro  does \n still  have  these  screws,  and  because \n these  screws  are  in  the  same  positions, \n the  new  phone  does  still  have  full \n compatibility  with  the  old  phone's \n accessories.  So  you  could  still  carry \n over  the  old  phone  stand  or  the  old \n wallet  or  the  old  lanyard  and  they  will \n still  bolt  in  place  in  the  exact  same \n way.  Plus  these  interchangeable  lenses, \n they  are  actually  extremely  cool.  But \n we'll  get  to  them  when  we  talk  about \n cameras.  First  though,  what's  this  phone \n like  to  actually  live  with?  Well, \n folks,  they've  done  it  again.  As  far  as \n the  phone  experience,  this  keeps \n everything  I  loved  about  the  first  phone \n and  fixes  pretty  much  everything  I  felt \n was  lacking.  like  NFC.  We  didn't  have  it \n before.  We  do  now.  So,  you  can  use \n Google  Pay.  The  storage  is  not  massive. \n Like,  it  starts  at  128  gigs,  but  you  can \n expand  it  with  micro  SD  by  up  to  2  TB. \n You  are  getting  a  display  here  that  does \n not  feel  normal  for  this  price. \n Completely  even  borders  around  the \n edges,  which  we  didn't  have  on  the  CMF1. \n And  the  panel  itself  is  AMOLED.  It  has  a \n 120  Hz  refresh  rate,  which  can  scale \n down  when  needed  to  save  battery.  Its \n brightness  is  not  quite  flagship,  but \n definitely  not  budget.  Point  is,  when \n you  watch  videos  on  this  thing,  it  is  a \n high-end  viewing  experience.  It  doesn't \n feel  oversharpened.  It  doesn't  look \n washed  out.  It's  very  close  to  the  best \n phones  you  can  buy.  The  speaker  isn't. \n It's  a  single  mono  speaker  that  shoots \n out  from  the  bottom.  But  it  does  have \n one  twist,  a  new  feature  called  ultra \n volume  where  you  can  go  50%  above  max \n volume,  which  nothing  is  saying \n shouldn't  damage  the  speaker  as  long  as \n you're  not  going  crazy  with  it  and  using \n it  all  the  time.  And  it  does  actually \n make  a  big  difference.  Let  me  give  you  a \n real  time  demo.  So,  you're  these  ears. \n This  is  what  the  phone  would  normally \n sound  like  to  you  on  max \n volume.  Now,  we're  going  to  go  up  to \n boost \n volume.  Hopefully,  you  could  tell  quite \n a  tangible  difference.  Battery  is \n stellar.  It's  the  same  sized  5,000  mAh \n battery  as  last  time,  but  just  now  with \n a  more  efficient  display  and  more \n efficient  software.  So,  we're  talking  7 \n and  1/2  hours  of  screen  on  time  if  you \n push  the  thing,  but  you  could  easily \n make  this  phone  last  2  days  if  you \n wanted  to.  The  software  is  smooth,  like \n really,  really  smooth.  It's  smooth \n enough  that  you  completely  forget  when \n you're  using  this  thing  that  it  isn't \n like  an  upper  mid-range  600lb  device. \n The  only  few  times  you're  reminded  are \n when  the  odd  thing  takes  a  little  bit \n longer  to  load  than  you  were  expecting. \n But  that  only  feels  jarring  because  of \n how  insanely  slick  the  rest  of  the \n experience  is.  It's  that  sweet  spot \n combination  of  just  good  enough \n hardware.  The  base  model  here  has  8  gigs \n of  RAM  and  the  MediaTek  Dimensity  7300 \n Pro  chip,  which  is  a  very  modest  5  to \n 10%  faster  than  what  we  got  before,  but \n still  capable  enough  to  play,  say,  every \n game  on  at least  medium  settings,  but \n that's  paired  with  a  lot  of  care  put \n into  optimization.  And  that's  the \n difference.  While  for  most  big \n companies,  budget  phones,  they're  an \n afterthought  because  they  make  a \n fraction  of  the  profit  per  phone,  you \n still  feel  here  as  a  user  of  this  phone, \n like  your  experience  has  been  the  first \n priority.  Now,  that  might  change  in  the \n future.  I  already  get  the  feeling  that \n nothing  is  starting  to  evolve  into  one \n of  these  bigger  companies  with  tons  of \n product  lines  with  pro  products  plus \n products,  budget  versions  of  products. \n They've  got  their  own  ecosystem.  It  is \n frankly  getting  a  bit  convoluted,  but \n thus  far,  I  haven't  seen  that  affect  the \n quality  of  the  software.  Nothing  OS  is \n still  very  light  on  bloatware,  even  if  I \n haven't  exactly  made  it  look  it  right \n now.  And  you  do  get  three  years  of  OS \n updates,  which  by  Western  standards  at \n least  is  very  acceptable  for  a  budget \n phone.  And  then  there  are  some  brand  new \n features.  You've  now  got  customizable \n widgets  on  your  lock  screen.  You've  got \n this  new  smart  app  drawer,  which,  you \n know,  having  installed  like  100 \n applications  onto  this  is  extremely \n clutch.  has  done  all  the  organization \n for  me  with  now  an  extra  private  space \n for  the  apps,  files  or  photos  that  you \n don't  want  anyone  else  to  see.  And  then \n we've  got  this  rather  curious  essential \n key  which  is  this  very  unique  feeling \n rounded  glossy  button  which  does \n actually  help  to  not  get  it  confused \n with  the  power  key.  So  you  press  this \n button,  it  takes  a  screenshot  and  it \n gives  you  the  option  to  add  a  note.  You \n hold  this  button,  it  takes  a  screenshot \n and  lets  you  give  a  voice  command.  And \n then  you  double  tap  this  button  and  it \n opens  up  your  essential  space  where  all \n of  this  stuff  is  being  collected.  And  I \n think  there  is  a  very  useful  feature  set \n buried  inside  of \n here \n somewhere.  I  just  can't  find  it.  I  love \n the  idea.  I  love  the  idea  that,  you \n know,  we're  using  50  different  apps  at \n this  point.  And  each  one  has  its  own  way \n of  bookmarking  things  and  trying  to  save \n information,  which  is  why  this  is  trying \n to  become  the  one  space  that  brings \n together  everything  that  you  want  to \n keep  and  everything  that  you  need  to \n remember.  So,  the  company  is  basically \n saying  instead  of  saving  that  post  on \n Instagram,  add  it  to  your  essential \n space  organized  into  the  various \n different  collections  that  you've \n created.  Instead  of  opening  up  Google \n calendar  to  add  an  upcoming  event,  just \n tell  your  essential  space  to  remind  you \n in  3  hours.  You  can  even  if  you  open  up \n your  camera  app  and  then  hit  the \n essential  key,  take  a  photo  and  attach  a \n note.  Like  I  was  looking  at  London \n restaurants  recently.  You  can  point  to \n one  and  tell  it  to  remind  you  to  book  it \n on  Friday.  And  it's  even  got  AI  built \n into  it  that  tries  to  understand  what  it \n is  that  you've  just  captured,  which  I \n assume  might  help  you  to  organize  it  in \n the  future.  But  right  now  doesn't  feel \n like  it's  quite  there.  It's  designed  in \n a  little  bit  of  a  convoluted  way.  It \n works  pretty  unreliably.  like  half  the \n time  it  doesn't  understand  me,  right?  Or \n doesn't  register  what  I'm  trying  to  ask \n it  to  do  and  you  can't  yet  organize \n anything  or  search  through  the  things \n that  you  have  saved.  It  needs  more \n cooking,  but  it  might  taste  great  when \n it's  done.  And  now,  just  before  we  wrap \n this  all  up,  the  time  has  come  to  talk \n about  one  of  the  most  unique  parts  of \n this  experience,  the  cameras.  So \n accessories  aside  for  a  minute,  because \n while  this  is  very  cool,  of  course,  the \n key  key  reason  that  I  liked  the  CMF \n phone  1  so  much  is  that  even  if  you  had \n none  of  the  extras,  it  was  still  a  very \n polished  experience  for  its  price  and \n the  camera  was  one  of  the  main  areas \n that  came  through.  And  so  with  that  in \n mind,  it's  actually  a  little  bit  crazy \n just  how  much  the  company  has  further \n upgraded  them  here.  So,  the  50  MP  main \n camera  on  the  old  phone  is  still  50 \n megap,  but  now  using  a  substantially \n bigger  camera  sensor,  and  the  difference \n is  immediately  obvious,  like  side  by \n side  with  the  last  already  pretty  good \n budget  camera,  shots  are  brighter, \n they're  crispier,  they  have  more  depth. \n That  fairly  useless  camera  at  the  top, \n which  was  just  there  to  assist  the  main \n camera,  has  been  replaced  by  an  8 \n megapixel  ultrawide  now,  which,  as  you'd \n probably  expect,  is  not  amazing,  but \n it's  as  good  as  ultrawide  cameras  at \n this  price  tend  to  be.  And  then \n completely  separate  to  both  of  those \n cameras,  there's  now  a  brand  new  50 \n megapixel,  two  times  telephoto  camera, \n too.  And  this  is  a  pretty  huge \n improvement.  It  gives  you  basically \n twice  as  much  power  to  be  able  to  zoom \n longer  distances.  And  even  more \n importantly  for  me,  a  better  quality \n portrait  mode.  You're  not  about  to \n confuse  this  with  a  Samsung  Galaxy  S25 \n Ultra  camera.  You  will  notice  lag  while \n using  it.  You  will  notice  bits  of \n jitteriness  from  the  lack  of  optical \n image  stabilization,  and  its  image \n processing  is  not  as  advanced  as  more \n intelligent  phones,  leading  to  the  odd \n shots  with  very  obvious  over  or \n underexposure.  Then  again,  show  me  a \n 200lb  phone  that  does  it  better  than \n this.  So,  what  happens  when  you  add \n these  lenses?  Well,  for  starters,  you \n got  the  fisheye,  which  on  first  glance \n seems  very  strange  because  you  put  it \n onto  your  main  camera  and  it  basically \n turns  that  main  camera  into  an  ultrawide \n with  almost  the  exact  same  field  of  view \n as  your  ultrawide  camera.  But  then  in \n another  way,  that's  also  the  upside.  You \n can  take  ultra  wide  shots  with  the \n quality  of  your  main  camera,  although \n with  quite  a  lot  of  softness  around  the \n edges.  That  does  make  it  feel  artsy,  but \n would  also  probably  put  me  off  using  it. \n The  second  though  is  the  macro  lens, \n which  is  extremely  good.  It  gives  your \n main  camera  the  ability  to  focus  at  very \n close  distances.  And  this  is  something \n that  you  don't  really  get  to  see  without \n a  lens  like  this.  It's  very  highquality \n close-up  photography.  Like  the  complete \n opposite  of  those  tacky  2  megap  macro \n cameras  that  cheap  phones  used  to  be \n famous  for.  So,  here's  the  down.  This  is \n not  what  I  was  expecting  it  would  be, \n but  it's  every  bit  as  great  as  I  was \n hoping  it  would  be.  What  I  was  expecting \n when  I  saw  the  price  was  big  changes  to \n the  way  that  this  accessory  ecosystem \n works  and  a  real  level  up  in  terms  of \n what  it  means  you  can  do.  But  with  the \n phone  itself  being  largely  the  same.  In \n reality,  kind  of  the  opposite.  Like \n there  aren't  that  many  exclusive  new \n accessories.  And  I  don't  think  the  ones \n that  they  have  made  are  particularly \n game  changers,  especially  because  of \n this  whole  fiddle  with  this  universal \n cover  that  you  have  to  do.  But  then  the \n phone  itself  is  far  more  of  an \n improvement  than  the  small  price  jump \n would  make  you  think.  Especially  in  this \n budget  segment,  things  don't  usually \n move  this  fast,  making  this,  as \n prophesized,  instantly  recommendable.",
