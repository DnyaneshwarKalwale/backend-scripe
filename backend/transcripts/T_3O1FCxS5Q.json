And  so  it's  our  job \n to  find  out  which  of  them  are  game \n changers  that  other  phones  need  to  start \n copying  and  which  of  them  are  game  overs \n that  no  one  should  ever  try  to  make \n again.  Let's  get  stranger  as  we  go. \n Starting  with  a  brand  new  minimal  phone, \n which  is  a  bit  of  a  trend  in  recent \n years,  like  phones  that  are  purposefully \n stripped  back  to  become  less \n distracting.  But  this  is  meant  to  be  the \n king  of  them. \n Because  while  it  might  look  on  the \n surface  like  every  other  minimalist \n phone  with  its  e-  in  display  and  its \n textbased  user  interface,  this  device \n also  runs  full  Android  14  with  complete \n access  to  the  Play  Store.  And  that  is \n fascinating  because  either  you  could \n say,  \"Oh  my  god,  the  peace  of  mind  of  a \n minimalist  phone  combined  with  the  full \n perks  of  a  normal  smartphone.  Sign  me \n up.\"  But  then  on  the  other  hand,  if  you \n now  have  access  to  every  single  app, \n hasn't  this  just  become  a  normal \n smartphone?  but  now  with  a  laggy  black \n and  white  screen.  I'm  so  curious.  What \n is  Instagram  like  on  this?  It  feels  like \n just  enough  to  be  able  to  catch  up  with \n what  your  friends  are  up  to  while \n feeling  paired  back  enough  that  I  don't \n feel  like  I'm  going to  get  lost  in  it. \n Okay,  what  about  a  game?  So,  you  swipe \n up  and  then  you  can  search  for  apps \n here.  I  do  think  this  physical  keyboard \n was  a  good  decision.  Like,  I'm  not \n normally  a  fan  of  the  idea,  but  typing \n on  an  e-  in  screen  because  of  the  slow \n refresh  rate  is  usually  one  of the \n biggest  turn-offs.  So,  it's  a  really \n good  way  of  getting  around  that.  Oh, \n this  is  actually  so  cool.  So,  when  you \n start  typing,  as  soon  as  it  realizes \n that  there's  only  one  app  that  you  could \n be  wanting  to  open,  it  just  opens  it. \n So,  PO  for  Pok√©mon  and  we're  in.  Damn, \n that  was  fast.  So,  this  game  is  my \n current  weakness.  Ah,  okay.  We  have  a \n bit  of  a  contrast  problem  here.  And \n while  you  can  tune  the  display,  there \n isn't  actually  a  setting  that's  going  to \n make  this  work  perfectly.  You  can  set  it \n to  a  low  refresh  rate,  which  makes  it \n really  clear,  but  then  any  moving  object \n will  consistently  pulse  like  this.  So, \n you  kind  of  have  to  set  it  to  the  fast \n refresh  rate  option,  but  then  it  becomes \n pretty  hard  to  read.  That  said,  I \n wouldn't  knock  this  too  hard.  This  is \n the  closest  I  have  ever  seen  an  e-  in \n phone  feel  like  a  normal  smartphone.  And \n they  have  also  told  me  that  they  are \n working  on  updates  to  make  this  more \n balanced.  And  then  there  are  also \n cameras.  There's  a  front  one  right  in \n this  bottom  corner  and  then  a  16 \n megapixel  autofocus  camera  on  the  back, \n which  is  kind  of  trippy  cuz  while  the \n photos  look  like  this  while  they're  on \n the  phone,  upload  them  to  a  computer  and \n it's  actually  this.  Not  great,  but  not \n bad.  So,  is  this  a  game  changer?  I \n actually  think  that  it  is.  Like,  I'm  not \n the  target  market  for  a  minimalist \n phone.  I  need  to  be  able  to  check  our \n videos  in  full  color  before  I  post  them. \n I'm  very  attached  to  having  a  high-end \n camera  system,  but  if  minimalism  was \n what  you  were  searching  for,  then  I \n really  like  that  this  lets  you  have \n minimalism,  but  in  a  way  that  you  can \n decide  what  minimalism  means  to  you.  You \n have  the  flexibility  to  pick  and  choose \n what  you'll  let  yourself  do  on  it,  and \n pretty  much  everything  can  work.  I  mean, \n the  thing's  even  got  a  sidemounted \n fingerprint  scanner.  Supports  fast \n wireless  charging.  It's  got  a  headphone \n jack.  It's  got  expandable  storage.  I'm  a \n big  fan.  So,  that  was  a  niche  product \n from  a  niche  company.  But  what  happens \n when  you  get  a  niche  product  from  a \n mainstream  company?  This  is  the  Samsung \n Galaxy  A80,  and  it  has  hands  down  one  of \n the  coolest  hardware  features  of  any \n [Music] \n smartphone  because  can  your  phone  do \n this? \n I  didn't  think  so.  I  actually  remember \n going  hands-on  with  this  A80  at  the \n launch  event  in  2019,  thinking  this \n needs  to  become  a  thing.  I  mean,  think \n about  it.  This  system  means  that  you \n just  need  to  build  one  set  of  cameras, \n and  you  get  to  use  that  set  of  cameras \n on  both  the  back  and  the  front  of  the \n phone.  And  that  makes  it  such  a  good \n selfie  camera  that  this  2019  phone  is \n still  like  better  than  my  iPhone  16  Pro \n Max  from  2025.  Doing  the  camera  like \n this  also  erased  the  need  for  a  selfie \n camera  on  the  front,  making  this  phone \n completely  notchless,  which  Samsung  was \n so  proud  of  that  they  even  named  this \n the  new  infinity  display  technology. \n It's  pretty  clear  why  from  2019  to  2021, \n motorized  camera  systems  exploded  in \n popularity,  very  quickly  becoming  a \n standard  expected  smartphone  feature. \n They  were  building  and  building  and \n traction  and  then  suddenly  they  stopped. \n Motorized  camera  systems  are  actually \n generally  a  pretty  bad  idea.  But  why? \n Well,  moving  parts  equals  less \n protection  from  the  elements.  Like, \n there's  just  so  much  more  room  for  stuff \n to  get  inside.  There's  more  things  that \n can  break.  And  actually,  as  a  very  good \n demonstration  of  this,  we  bought  this \n phone  refurbished.  And  you  can  see  when \n the  camera  flips  around  that  it's  not \n actually  flipping  to  the  completely  flat \n state  like  it's  supposed  to.  It's  very \n slightly  slanted  up.  The  whole  thing \n adds  waiting  time.  You  know,  it's  cool \n the  first  100  times  you  do  it,  but  after \n that,  you  are  just  adding  an  extra  2 \n seconds  every  time  you  want  to  use  the \n thing.  The  mechanism  for  this  movement \n in  itself  takes  up  space  which  companies \n have  now  realized  that  people  would \n rather  spend  on  just  having  bigger \n batteries.  But  I  think  the  single  most \n important  thing,  a  mechanism  like  this \n one  that  flips  the  whole  set  of  cameras \n gets  harder  and  harder  to  pull  off  the \n bigger  the  cameras  that  you're  trying  to \n flip  are.  And  so  if  you  actually  wanted \n to  keep  up  with  the  camera  quality  of \n other  phones,  you  can't  realistically \n even  pull  this  off.  So,  a  pretty  cool \n case  study  of  an  idea  that  you  can  see \n why  Samsung  wanted  to  try,  but  you  can \n also  see  why  Samsung  decided  that  it \n needed  to \n die.  So,  how  do  you  get  stranger  than  a \n phone  that  can  change  its  camera?  Well, \n a  phone  that  can  change  everything.  This \n is  the  LG  G5,  which  while  still  not \n actually  the  strangest  LG  phone  in  this \n video,  is  still  pretty  odd  because  this \n is  one  of  the  first  proper  attempts  at  a \n modular \n smartphone,  which \n means  this  is  kind  of  like  a  piece  of \n Lego.  Just  to  be  clear,  I  have  just \n pulled  off  the  bottom  third  of  this \n phone.  This  is  charging  port.  This  is \n speakers.  This  is  battery.  If  I  just \n want  the \n battery,  how  we  got  that?  And  I  can  even \n put  that  battery  into  a  different  style \n of  bass.  So  I  could  stick  it  into  the \n Bang  &  Olivesson  hi-fi  module,  which \n adds  a  headphone  jack  and  a  32-bit  DACK \n that  upscales  any  audio  going  to  it.  Or \n I  stick  it  into  the  camera  grip  like  so. \n That  slots  back  into  the  phone.  And \n suddenly  my  smartphone  has  a  two-stage \n shutter  button,  a  zoom  dial  over  here, \n and  a  built-in  grip  for  my  hand,  and  an \n extra  50%  battery  capacity,  which  is \n pretty  sick.  In  a  lot  of  ways,  this \n modularity  conversation  is  exactly  the \n same  as  the  motorized  and  rotating \n cameras  conversation  in  that  the  first \n time  you  look  at  this,  you  think,  \"Oh  my \n god,  the  ability  to  tune  my  smartphone \n to  my  exact  preferences  and  my  exact \n budget  to  be  able  to  swap  out  my  battery \n as  simply  as  this  instead  of  having  to \n throw  my  whole  phone  away  when  it  gets \n older.  Of  course,  this  makes  sense.  I \n mean,  this  is  a  massive  part  of  why  PCs \n are  so  desirable.  You  pick  the  exact \n parts  that  you  want.\"  And  so  it's  not \n surprising  that  this  idea  of  a  modular \n phone  almost  became  like  the  holy  grail \n that  companies  were  scrambling  to  try \n and  make  happen  with  even  Google \n themselves  stepping  in  to  try  to  create \n a  device  in  which  you  could  just  slide \n out  the  components  you  don't  want  and \n slide  in  the  ones  you  do.  But  it  never \n caught  on.  See  unlike  a  PC  for  which \n pretty  much  every  PC  case  has  tons  of \n space  inside  so  you  can  freely  swap \n components  even  if  they  are  different \n sizes  with  a  smartphone  everything  has \n to  fit  exactly  which  creates  two \n problems.  a  that  how  do  you  create  one \n phone  body  that  is  so  flexible  that \n someone  could  choose  anything  from  a \n camera  this  big  to  a  prolevel  camera \n this  big  and  then  if  you  are  only  going \n to  use  a  camera  this  big  why  would  you \n pay  for  such  an  expensive  body  that  has \n specifically  costed  more  because  it  has \n all  the  connectors  and  image  signal \n processors  needed  to  support  the \n higherend  camera  that  you're  not  even \n taking  advantage  of  and  then  B  how  do \n you  make  it  so such  that  all  of  these \n pieces  they  don't  just  become  e-waste \n the  second  that  a  new  model  comes  out \n like  with  this  LG  G5  5.  Either  LG \n decides  that  all  their  future  phones  are \n going  to  have  this  exact  same  dated \n shape,  this  size  screen,  and  the  exact \n same  connectors,  or  these  modules  become \n useless  the  moment  that  you  upgrade  your \n phone,  thus  actually  creating  even  more \n waste  than  if  they  just  built  three \n different  versions  of  this  phone,  which \n each  had  one  of  these  bases  fixed  inside \n of  them.  And  you,  as  the  buyer  would \n then  just  pick  the  one  that  you  wanted. \n So,  I  think  it's  fair  to  say  that  the \n idea  of  a  modular  smartphone  being \n something  that  any  company  in  2025 \n should  be  striving  for  is  not  a  good \n idea.  The  only  situation  that  modularity \n has  kind  of  worked  for  is  the  fair \n phones  and  the  CMF  phones.  But  that's \n only  because  for  the  fair  phones,  the \n swappability  is  not  there  so  that  you \n can  upgrade  things.  It  just  lets  you \n repair  what  you  have  more  easily.  And \n for  the  CMF,  the  things  that  you're \n swapping  are  accessories  as  opposed  to \n core  system  components.  But  the \n craziness  is  not  reserved  for  just  old \n phones.  Like  this  is  the  new  ZTE  Nubia \n Music  Phone  2.  And  there  are  two  things \n that  are  kind  of  cool  about  it.  A  that \n it's  got  not  one,  not  two,  but  three \n speakers  around  it.  And  B,  it's  only \n around \n $90.  My  goodness.  Now  that  is  how  you \n stand  out.  Is  it  premium?  Questionable. \n Is  it  fun?  Hell  yes.  like  this.  The \n ultra  speaker,  as  they  call  it,  is \n designed  to  look  like  a  record  player. \n There's  lighting  effects  specifically \n for  when  you're  playing  music,  which  are \n not  very  good,  I'll  be  honest.  And  there \n is  also  a  headphone  jack.  This  is  what \n we're  here  for,  though.  This  speaker  is \n apparently  so  powerful.  The  ZTE  says  it \n can  hit  volumes  600%  louder  than  your \n average  phone  speaker.  They  are  so  proud \n of  this  that  there  is  actually  a  setting \n here  that  turns  this  phone  into  a \n Bluetooth  speaker  that  other  phones  can \n connect  to.  What's  also  very  unique  is \n that  this  thing  has  a  max  volume,  but \n then  specifically  lets  you  further  dial \n it  up  two  more  stages.  So,  this  is  my \n iPhone  16  Pro  Max \n volume.  I  promise  this  is  not  my \n playlist.  Now,  this  is  the \n [Music] \n Nubia.  I'm  sorry,  but  no,  that's  not  it. \n The  thing  is  on  max  volume,  and  if  it \n was  even  close  to  600%  louder  than  a \n normal  phone,  I  would  absolutely  be  able \n to  tell.  But  it  literally  sounds  the \n same  volume  as  my  iPhone,  but  just  like \n worse.  You  can  just  tell  that  it's  got \n so  much  less  precision  and  control  over \n how  the  music  is  coming  out.  Well,  that \n is  just  a  massive  bummer  cuz  in  concept, \n I  was  ready  to  love  this.  A  smartphone \n that  prioritizes  speaker  quality  and \n does  so  in  a  way  that  it's  not  really \n sacrificing  on  the  price  or  the  size  of \n the  battery.  This  still  has  a  big  5,000 \n mAh  cell,  but  actually  listening  to  it, \n the  illusion  is  shattered.  It  kind  of \n proves  in  a  way  that  good  sound  needs \n more  than  just  a  big  unit  at  the  back, \n but  also  that  the  big  unit  at  the  back \n isn't  really  adding  much.  It  could  just \n be  that  because  phones  are  so  thin,  that \n even  though  this  speaker  has  a  lot  of \n area,  it  still  doesn't  have  the  depth  to \n be  able  to  push  large  volumes  of  air  to \n make  any  kind  of  bass  impact.  So  until  I \n use  a  phone  that  executes  on  this  idea  a \n lot  better  than  this  one  does,  music \n phones  are  not  really \n speaking  to \n me.  But  Bit  Defender  Scamo,  our  sponsor, \n very  literally  is  if  you  add  it  as  a \n contact  on  your  phone.  This  is  one  of \n the  most  no-brainer  things  you  can  do \n cuz  it  means  the  second  that  you  have \n any  doubt  about  the  security  of \n something  that  you  see,  you  just  ping  it \n over  and  Scamio  will  text  back  to  you \n whether  you  have  anything  to  worry \n about.  And  this  has  both  saved  my  butt \n from  accidentally  clicking  links  that \n have  the  potential  to  retrieve  my \n personal  data  or  make  me  pay  for  a \n package  that  doesn't  exist,  but  also \n there's  so  much  stuff  that  Gmail  will \n just  like  chuck  into  your  junk  folder. \n And  some  of  it  might  well  be  legitimate \n stuff  that  you  actually  signed  up  for \n and  wanted  to  receive.  Either  way,  Scamo \n will  get  to  the  bottom  of  it.  And  it  is \n completely  free  because  this  isn't  Bit \n Defender's  main  business.  They  have  very \n deep,  very  powerful  security  software \n that  is  paid,  but  they  built  Scamio  as  a \n completely  separate  free  offering  that's \n just  using  the  same  tech.  So,  link  below \n to  set  it  up  in  literally  40  seconds. \n But  now  we  are  getting  to  one  of  the \n most  absurd  phones  that  I  have  ever \n gotten  my  hands  on  because  this  thing, \n the  Essential  Phone  PH2,  announced  in \n 2019,  technically  never  even  actually \n released.  And  so,  as  you  can  imagine, \n actually  getting  hold  of  it  was  like  a \n wild  goose  chase  of  browsing  forums, \n following  up  on  rumors  until  eventually \n we  tracked  the  thing  down  thanks  to  this \n lovely  chap  here.  So,  the  Essential \n Phone  PH1  released  in  2017,  headed  by \n Andy  Rubin,  one  of  the  lead  creators  of \n Android  itself.  The  main  selling  points \n were  a  a  largely  bezelless  display  that \n was  not  at  all  standard  at  the  time. \n This  was  actually  the  phone  that \n introduced  the  idea  of  a  camera  notch, \n funnily  enough,  and  b  a  click  connector \n for  attaching  modular  accessories  like  a \n 360¬∞  camera.  It  did  not  do  very  well.  It \n only  sold  about  150,000  units,  which  is \n why  the  company's  next  phone,  this  was \n cancelled,  but  it's  just  so  intriguing \n that  I  knew  I  was  going  to  have  to  find \n a  way  to  get  it  anyways.  It's  got  this \n super  weird  tall  thin  shape  which \n results  in  a  probably  never  before  seen \n resolution  of \n 2160x  560.  Like  actually  feels  amazing. \n Like  a  really  ergonomic  TV  remote  and \n that's  intentional.  This  phone  is \n designed  to  reinvent  how  we  interact \n with  our  devices  from  two  thumbs  and  two \n hands  to  one.  What's  the  dialer  like? \n It's  got  really  nice  haptic  feedback. \n You  can  tell  this  was  designed  to  be  a \n premium  product.  There's  also  a  game \n installed  called  Windup  Nights  2.  It \n feels  like  a  miniaturized  version  of \n playing  games  on  like  a  triple  monitor \n PC  setup.  It's  so  wide  and  it's  actually \n shockingly  playable  on  this  screen.  But \n bear  in  mind  that  this  game  has  been \n specifically  optimized  to  work  on  this \n phone.  You  would  not  be  able  to  expect \n that  just  any  game  you  download  will \n work  fine.  How  do  you  type  on  this \n thing?  Messages.  New  message.  Oh  my \n goodness  me.  You  see \n this?  It's  a  completely  diagonal \n keyboard,  which  is  really  strange,  but \n actually  in  a  way  kind  of  intuitive.  It \n uses  the  vertical  height  of  the  phone \n way  better  than  a  standard  keyboard \n layout  would.  But  it  still  makes  sure \n that  every  letter  is  within  the  natural \n arc  of  your  thumb.  Why  is  this  actually \n good?  And  then  as  far  as  like  general \n navigation  is  concerned,  you  swipe  up \n from  here  to  go  back  and  then  you  swipe \n up  from  here  to  go  home.  I  did  not \n expect  to  like  this  nearly  as  much  as  I \n actually  am.  Now  obviously  use  something \n like  this  and  you  would  run  into  a  very \n obvious  content  problem  in  that  unless \n the  entire  population  suddenly  decides \n that  they  want  to  start  producing  videos \n like  this,  most  media  that  you  consume \n is  only  going  to  fill  a  tiny  portion  of \n your  screen.  There  is  something  in  this. \n This  ultra  tall  screen  feels  almost \n designed  for  efficient  feed  scrolling. \n It  gives  your  thumb  tons  of  room  to \n maneuver  but  without  being  so  wide  that \n it  can't  reach  all  parts  of  it.  But  I \n wouldn't  call  it  game  changer  because  I \n think  for  the  vast  majority  of  people  a \n better  phone  would  just  be  one  that's  a \n little  bit  shorter  and  a  little  bit \n wider  or  in  other  words  just  a  high-end \n compact  phone.  If  you  are  even  slightly \n trypophobic  that  irrational  fear  of \n things  with  patterns  of  holes  in  them \n this  is  not  the  phone  for  you.  This  is \n the  Nokia  9  Pure  View  and  it  kind  of \n looks  like  a  spider  face. \n Why?  Well,  because  this  is  a  penta \n camera  system.  Also  a  2019  device,  by \n the  way.  Like,  was  there  something  in \n the  water  that \n year?  But  it's  stranger  than  that \n because  unlike  every  other  phone  that \n has  multiple  cameras,  where  those \n multiple  cameras  are  each  designed  to  be \n different  to  give  you  access  to \n different  levels  of  magnification,  the \n multiple  cameras  here  will  each  capture \n almost  an  identical  photo  at  the  same \n time  every  single  time  you  press  the \n shutter  button.  Three  of  them  are \n monochrome  sensors  which  capture  no \n color  and  focus  solely  on  light  and \n detail.  And  then  two  of  them  capturing \n color.  And  then  all  of  that  data  from \n all  five  cameras  is  merged  together  into \n one  supero  which  will  have  extreme \n levels  of  dynamic  range  because  each \n camera  is  shooting  at  different  levels \n of  exposure.  So  the  phone  has  a  very \n complete  understanding  of  what  your \n scene  looks  like.  It  should  have  very \n balanced  colors  taking  the  info  from \n both  color  cameras  and  1,200  layers  of \n depth  to  allow  for  full  refocusing  after \n you've  taken  your  shot.  And  so,  as  you \n would  probably  expect,  this  can  take \n incredible  photos  with  pretty  much  a \n limitless  ability  to  edit  the  shots \n after.  But  it  wasn't  a  good  phone. \n Having  five  of  the  exact  same  lens  means \n you  don't  get  an  ultrawide  camera.  You \n don't  get  a  zoom  camera.  It  was  the \n first  time  that  any  smartphone  company \n was  doing  anything  like  this.  So,  it's \n pretty  buggy.  And  most  importantly,  the \n lack  of  processing  power  at  the  time \n meant  that  every  photo  was  essentially \n combining  60  megapixels  of  raw  data  and \n took  a  full  10  seconds  to  process.  and \n the  phone  got  really  hot  doing  so.  But \n here's  what  I  think  is  really \n interesting  about  this.  I  think  the \n concept  here  should  not  be  disregarded. \n In  fact,  I  could  totally  see  how  a  2025 \n reimagined  version  of  this  could  become \n the  most  prograde  camera  on  a  smartphone \n today.  We've  got  way  faster  chips  now \n that  could  process  photos  like  this  and \n wouldn't  get  hot  doing  so.  And  we've  got \n AI  that  would  be  way  better  at \n extracting  the  most  detail  and  dynamic \n range  out  of  these  multiple  separate \n images.  I  would  say  that  this  failure  of \n a  phone  actually  has  the  potential  to  be \n a  gamecher.  I  think  what  it  was  trying \n to  do  was  just  ahead  of  what  the  tech  at \n the  time  was  able  to  pull  off.  But \n nothing  is  weirder  than  what  LG  has  done \n with  the  wing.  In  a  world  where  every \n phone  looks  like  a  glass  rectangle \n playing  it  safe,  LG  said,  \"Screw  it. \n We're  going  to  be  a  helicopter.  Let's \n see  if  there's  actually  any  merit  to \n it.\"  I  have  never  actually  seen  or  used \n this  phone  in  person.  The  entire  concept \n centers  around  this.  That's  freaking \n cool.  This  literally  looks  like \n something  I  would  have  doodled  as  a \n child  thinking  I'd  revolutionize \n smartphones.  And  in  theory,  this  is  a \n great  concept  cuz  in  one  phone  that's, \n you  know,  a  little  thicker  and  a  little \n heavier  than  a  normal  phone,  but  not  by \n much  at  all,  they  have  managed  to  fit \n two  displays  to  do  two  things  at  once. \n We  are  very  much  in  the  generation  of \n the  second  screen  experience.  Who \n doesn't  want  a  movie  playing  up  here \n with  a  little  bit  of  shopping  action \n happening  on  the  bottom  over  here?  Can  I \n just  sit  here  opening  my  Pok√©mon  packs? \n The  answer  to  which  feels  like  a  very \n resounding  yes.  Oh,  this  feels  good. \n That  is  weird.  But  it  does.  It's  true. \n It's  true.  It's  not  just  the  ability  to \n do  two  separate  things.  Like  there  are \n plenty  of  instances  where  you  can  just \n use  the  second  screen  as  kind  of  an \n assist  to  either  give  you  controls  to \n operate  what's  on  the  main  screen  or \n even  what  they've  done  in  Asphalt.  Use \n the  second  screen  as  a  mini  map  which  is \n extremely  unique.  This  is  the  craziest \n thing.  So  let's  say  I'm  in  the  middle  of \n messaging  someone.  I  open  up  the \n keyboard  on  the  bottom  screen.  I  flip \n the  whole  phone  over  and  you  give  it \n like  a  second.  Your  main  screen  is  going \n to  become  your  full  size \n keyboard.  That  is  special.  and  like \n actually  tangibly  makes  the  typing \n experience  way  more  comfortable.  So,  the \n way  that  I'm  looking  at  this  is  this \n whole  idea  of  one  mini  screen,  one  fulls \n size  screen  is  very  close  to  what  you \n would  get  on  a  flip  smartphone.  And  for \n some  people,  I  would  actually  say  this \n could  be  better  than  that  because  unlike \n a  flip  phone  where  you  can  only  use  one \n of  those  two  screens  at  once,  here  you \n can  actually  use  two.  However,  the \n hurdle  that  you  would  run  into  is  not \n the  flip  phones,  it's  the  bigger  fold \n phones  because  those  are  very  similar  to \n this  in  terms  of  body  size  when  they're \n folded  up.  But  it's  just  because  they \n open  with  a  hinge  instead  of  a  swivel, \n they're  more  space  efficient.  And  so \n their  main  inner  display  will  just  have \n more  space  to  do  stuff  than  actually \n both  LG  Wing  screens  put  together.  Plus, \n even  though  it's  definitely  not  as  cool \n as  this,  I  would  definitely  trust  a \n hinges  long-term  reliability  more  than  a \n swivel  mechanisms.  So,  I  like  this.  I \n like  it  a  lot  more  than  I  thought  I  was \n going  to,  but  its  functionality  has  been \n basically  absorbed  by  the  big  foldables. \n So,  it's  just  not \n needed.  See  if  we  can  make  it \n fly.  It's  got  wings.",
