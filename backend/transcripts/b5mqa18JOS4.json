  "transcript": "You  go  to  Madrid  Because  my  son  Mateo \n likes \n Mbappe  a  lot,  he's  a  big  fan.  I  really  see  him,  I \n see  him  as  a \n star.  It  was  perhaps  where  he  was  happiest  in \n football.  When  you  leave  a \n legacy  and  a  mark,  people  don't  forget.  You \n 've  never  had  an  idol,  no  idol,  to \n idolize,  to  copy,  no,  that.  You  ca \n n't  imagine  the  day  you  leave \n football.  It's  normal  for  players  to  be  33,  34,  and \n it's  a  gift,  in  my  opinion,  it's  a \n gift,  scoring  goals,  which  is  obviously  the  best \n feeling  in  the  world,  and  the  hardest  thing  in \n football  is  scoring  goals  and  not  suffering. \n That's \n football,  nothing  to  do  with  football. \n Being  the  owner  of  a  club  makes  more \n sense.  You  have  to  organize  your  return  when \n you  see  fit.  The  best  thing  is  that  when  you  finish  your  degree \n something  can  happen  there. \n 7,000  people.  7,000  people.  It's  going  to  be \n something  cool,  I  don't  rule  it  out  because  it's  a  club \n that  I  respect  a  lot.",
