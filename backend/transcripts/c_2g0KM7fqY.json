  "transcript": "Everyone  is  telling  you  to  be \n consistent.  Consistency  is  key.  That's \n what  they  say.  They  even  say  if  you  keep \n posting  every  day,  you  will  eventually \n succeed  on  LinkedIn.  Just  post  it.  And \n of  course,  there  is  a  part  of  truth  in \n this.  So  you  do  what  they  say.  You  post \n every  day  for  days,  for  weeks,  for \n months,  for  years.  The  problem  is  that \n you  see  a  big  gap  between  the  efforts \n you  commit  and  the  results  that  you  get. \n When  big  influencers  are  publishing \n every  day  on  LinkedIn,  they  get  likes, \n comments,  leads,  and  visibility.  But \n when  you  post  every  day,  you  get  only \n three,  four  friends  that  comment  on  your \n content.  So  you  know  that  you  are  not \n getting  any  leads,  visibility  or  even \n influence.  In  short,  you  are  consistent. \n But  despite  your  consistency,  you  are \n not  getting  the  results  that  you  want. \n Now,  what  if  I  told  you  that  consistency \n does  not  always  lead  to  success  on \n LinkedIn?  So  let  me  tell  you  something. \n Of  course,  you  need  to  be  consistent \n because  if  you  stop  within  1  month,  you \n will  not  be  able  to  perform.  You  will \n never  grow.  But  this  advice,  consistency \n is  the  key,  is  too  reductive.  They  are \n saying  this  as  if  it  was  the  only  key  to \n growth,  as  if  it  was  the  only  thing  that \n matters.  But  this  is  not  true. \n Consistency  is  not  the  only  key.  Most \n people  who  believe  this  are  missing  a \n crucial  part  of  their  content  strategy \n or  sometimes  they  don't  even  have  a \n content  strategy  at  all.  In  both  cases, \n we  are  missing  out  on  three  concepts. \n Those  three  concepts  made  me  over \n 140,000  followers  on  LinkedIn.  And  I'm \n going  to  tell  you  exactly  how  to  use \n them  in  this  video.  Let's  start  with  the \n first  concept.  As  you  know,  we  are \n living  in  a  world  where  people  have \n limited  attention.  They  are  bombarded \n with  information  all  the  time.  So,  every \n time  someone  logs  in  LinkedIn,  they  have \n a  limited  set  of  attention  credits. \n They're  going  to  scroll  on  LinkedIn  for \n maybe  10,  20,  or  even  30  minutes.  And \n during  this  time,  they  have  what  I  call \n attention  credits  that  they  can  spend  as \n they  want.  Let's  say  that  they're  going \n to  spend  10  attention  credits  for  every \n 10  minutes.  So,  when  they  are  reading \n your  hook,  they  will  ask  themselves, \n should  I  spend  an  attention  credits  on \n this  post?  Of  course,  this  is  a \n subconscious  mechanism,  but  it's  very \n important  for  you  to  understand  it  in \n order  to  know  that  they  are  not \n consuming  your  content  for  free.  Whether \n it's  a  carousel,  a  short  post  or  a \n video,  they  are  always  paying  with  their \n attention.  So  next  time  you  are  writing \n your  post,  don't  think  like,  oh,  even  if \n it's  not  good,  I  will  post  it  anyway \n because  it's  free  anyway.  Instead,  you \n should  think  they  are  going  to  spend \n their  attention  credits  on  my  content, \n so  I  should  make  it  perfect.  And  more \n precisely,  you  need  to  answer  those \n three  questions.  Question  number  one,  of \n course,  does  my  content  attract  the \n attention?  Because  if  you  are  not \n attracting  the  attention,  you  will  never \n be  able  to  convey  your  messages  and  the \n information  you  want  to  share.  So  here \n you  need  to  work  on  your  hook.  The  hook \n are  the  two  first  sentences  that  matter \n the  most.  You  need  to  trigger  curiosity \n with  the  hook  so  they  want  to  click  on \n view  more  and  read  the  rest  of  the  post. \n Question  number  two,  does  my  post  retain \n attention?  Here,  of  course,  it's  all \n about  delivering  valuable  insights.  So, \n it's  about  formatting  so  people  actually \n read  it  because  if  they  click  on  view \n more  and  then  they  see  a  long  big \n paragraph  of  text,  especially  on  mobile, \n they  will  probably  not  read  it.  Question \n number  three,  is  the  post  worth  their \n attention?  Because  if  you  first  attract \n the  attention,  second  retain  the \n attention,  but  at  the  end  they  think \n that  it  was  not  worth  their  attention, \n you  will  not  have  a  proper  long-term \n strategy  because  they  will  not  come  back \n to  your  posts.  And  remember,  at  some \n point  when  you  are  delivering  valuable \n insights  every  day,  it's  your  name  and \n your  picture  that  becomes  the  hook.  So \n this  was  the  first  concept  and  now  I'm \n going  to  talk  about  a  very  important \n second  concept.  If  you  are  publishing  on \n LinkedIn  every  day,  but  without  a \n content  strategy,  you  are  missing  out  on \n a  core  concept  called  positioning. \n Positioning  is  the  place  that  your  brand \n or  your  personal  brand  occupies  in  the \n mind  of  your  target  audience.  So  if  you \n are  talking  about  different  topics  every \n day  such  as  sales,  AI  and  then  the  next \n day  about  travel,  you  will  have  a \n diluted  position.  People  will  not  be \n able  to  associate  your  name  with  a  core \n expertise  or  a  core  topic.  So  they  will \n not  have  a  high  perceived  value  of  your \n account.  And  of  course  this  is  true  for \n any  channel.  So  you  need  to  work  on  your \n positioning.  And  before  I  explain  how, \n make  sure  to  have  a  look  at  my  content \n strategy  course  that  will  teach  you \n exactly  how  to  create  your  content \n strategy.  Now,  how  should  you  have  a \n proper  and  solid  positioning?  Well, \n instead  of  posting  about  many  different \n topics  every  day,  you  should  use  what  we \n call  content  pillars.  You  should  choose \n three  content  pillars  from  a  broad  topic \n to  a  very  specific  topic.  So,  every  time \n you  write  a  LinkedIn  post,  ask  yourself, \n does  it  match  at  least  one  of  my  content \n pillars?  This  way  you  will  have \n consistency  because  you  publish  every \n day  but  you  will  also  have  content \n consistency  because  you  always  publish \n about  the  same  topics.  So  here  people \n will  associate  your  name  with  an \n expertise.  For example,  my  content \n pillars  are  first  the  old  school  B2B \n marketing  playbook  is  out  of  date  and \n doesn't  work  anymore.  Second,  content \n marketing  is  the  new  best  tactic  for  B2B \n marketing.  And  third,  you  need  a \n long-term  strategy  to  succeed  and \n generate  more  revenue.  Those  are  my \n three  content  pillars.  And  I  also  add  a \n last  one  which  is  about  my  personal \n brand.  So,  for  example,  some  of  my  posts \n like  this  one  about  my  backstory  really \n helped  me  to  position  myself  as  an \n authority.  If  you  want  to  have  a \n detailed  tutorial  on  how  to  choose  your \n content  pillars,  your  subtopics,  and  to \n write  LinkedIn  posts,  you  should  have  a \n look  at  my  content  strategy  course  where \n I  explain  exactly  how  to  do  it.  Click \n the  link  in  the  description.  Now  let's \n move  on  to  the  third  concept.  This  is \n linked  to  something  that  I've  said \n earlier  in  the  video.  Most  people  think \n that  publishing  content  is  free  anyway. \n So  they  publish  whatever  they  have  and \n sometimes  they  even  publish  without \n thinking.  They  try  to  sell  in  their \n first  post.  They  use  AI  to  create \n generic  content  that  no  one  wants  to \n read  or  they  publish  about  a  topic  that \n is  far  away  from  their  expertise,  their \n career  or  their  business.  Now  here  is \n the  concept.  There  is  a  negative \n mechanism  that  is  called  marketing \n depth.  Let  me  explain  it  to  you.  If  you \n are  publishing  every  day  bad  content, \n people  will  associate  your  personal \n brand  or  your  brand  with  a  negative \n feeling  or  a  negative  outcome.  This  is \n called  the  horn  effect  in  opposition  to \n the  aloe  effect.  It's  a  simple \n subconscious  psychology  mechanism.  Here \n is  what  happens  in  your  audience  mind. \n They  see  you  publish  bad  content.  So \n they  think  that  if  your  content  is  bad, \n probably  your  company  offers  or  your \n brand  will  be  bad  as  well.  So  of  course \n as  you  understood  you  should  avoid  this \n horn  effect  at  all  costs.  But  third  you \n should  also  create  your  content  plan.  So \n to  create  a  content  plan  you  will \n analyze  your  content  strategy  and  also \n your  target  audience  based  on  those  two \n elements.  You  will  list  all  the  pieces \n of  content  that  you  need  to  create  with \n the  ideas  types  of  content  the  formats \n and  the  channels.  Now  let  me  give  you  an \n advice  to  plan  your  content.  I  created \n the  authority  first  framework  that  helps \n you  to  create  your  content  repartition. \n First  you  should  publish  70%  of \n authority  content.  So  content  about  your \n industry,  your  expertise,  case  studies, \n how  to  install  a  process  or  workflow  you \n installed.  Then  15%  should  be  dedicated \n to  your  personal  brand  or  your  brand \n backstory  posts,  opinions  that  you  have \n or  build  in  public.  And  the  last  15%  is \n offer  content.  So  at  the  end  of  the  day, \n you  can  also  use  LinkedIn  to  sell  your \n offer.  So  you  can  launch  new  products \n with  your  posts.  You  can  use  the  problem \n agitate  solution  framework  to  sell  your \n offer.  And  you  can  also  add  a  call  to \n action  to  target  your  audience.  All \n right.  Now  you  have  the  three  core \n concepts  that  you  need  to  use  in  order \n to  succeed  on  LinkedIn  because \n consistency  is  very  important,  but  it's \n not  the  only  key.  Indeed,  if  it  was  the \n only  key,  everyone  who  posted  every  day \n would  succeed.",
