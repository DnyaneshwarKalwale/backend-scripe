And  so, \n clearly,  I  have  questions.  Firstly,  how \n how  have  they  built  a  phone  that  much \n thinner  than  their  others?  Secondly, \n why?  Like,  who's  asking  for  these  thin \n phones?  What's  the  supposed  benefit?  And \n then  finally,  should  you  really  consider \n buying  it,  or  is  this  actually  just  a \n very  prettyl  looking  money  trap?  So,  the \n how  part  of  this  equation  is  pretty \n simple.  Samsung  have  made  this  phone  so \n thin  by  taking  their  top-end  Galaxy  S25 \n Ultra  and  chopping  things  up.  The  Edge \n has  two  fewer  cameras.  There's  no  three \n time  zoom  camera.  There's  no  five  time \n zoom  camera.  And  this  whole  laser \n autofocus  thing  over  here,  that's  gone, \n too.  And  while  the  phone  does  still  keep \n an  ultrawide  camera,  that's  been \n downgraded.  So,  instead  of  the  50 \n megapixel  one  on  the  Ultra,  the  Edge  has \n 12.  But  that  is  not  all.  There's  no  S \n Pen  baked  inside  like  there  is  on  the \n Ultra.  The  screen  doesn't  have  that \n absolutely  amazing  anti-reflective \n coating  that  improves  visibility.  The \n speakers,  I  was  sitting  there  doing  some \n blind  testing  and  exactly  as  you'd \n expect  given  that  there's  less  space \n inside  the  phone.  The  ones  on  the  Edge \n have  quite  a  bit  less  of  a  thump  than \n the  ones  on  the  Ultra.  All  finished  off \n by  also  a  significantly  smaller  battery. \n 3,900  mAh  on  the  edge  compared  to  5,000 \n mAh.  Now,  if  the  question  you're  asking \n me  is,  has  all  of  this  feature  cutting \n made  the  phone  feel  better  in  the  hands? \n My  answer  would  be,  hell  yeah.  Picking \n this  phone  up  was  very  reminiscent  of  my \n first  time  picking  up  a  MacBook  Air  or \n one  of  the  new  iPads.  30%  thinner  and \n 25%  lighter  might  not  sound  like \n transformative  figures,  but  they \n absolutely  feel  like  them.  And  I  think \n it  feels  particularly  good  because \n unlike  most  light  phones  which  achieve \n that  lightness  by  using  cheap  plastic, \n this  is  light  while  still  having  that \n premium  titanium  construction  and  the \n top-  end  Gorilla  Glass  Ceramic  2  on  its \n screen.  It  just  feels  cool  that  you  can \n have  this  form  factor  while  still  having \n most  modern  luxuries  like  an  ultra \n bright  almost  borderless  display,  like \n all  the  AI  shenanigans  like  Samsung's \n extremely  good  object  eraser  and \n generative  AI  editor.  Here  is  where  it \n gets  a  little  bit  strange.  While  Samsung \n have  managed  to  make  this  phone  thinner \n by  cutting  all  these  features  down,  the \n one  thing  they  haven't  cut  is  the  price. \n The  S25  Edge  is  releasing  at  £1,99  here \n in  the  UK,  which  yes,  is  £150  cheaper \n than  what  the  S25  Ultra  launched  at.  But \n then  if  you  look  at  what  you  can  get  the \n S25  Ultra  for  now,  it's  the  same  price, \n like  exactly  from  Samsung.  So  what?  You \n can  either  buy  the  phone  with  everything \n or  you  can  buy  the  phone  without \n everything  and  you  pay  the  same.  Which \n brings  me  to  the  why.  Why  then  did \n Samsung  make  something  that  when  you \n glance  at  the  spec  sheet  looks  like  they \n lost  a  bet  with  the  design  in  turn? \n Well,  here  is  why  I  think  it's  not  a \n stupid  idea.  If  you're  a  consumer  and \n you  got  a  high  income,  I  don't  think \n it's  a  crazy  idea  that  you  might  want  to \n spend  £1,100  on  a  phone.  It's  like  the \n single  possession  that  you're  going  to \n be  spending  most  of  your  spare  time  on \n for  maybe  the  next  5  years.  But  then \n previously,  if  you'd  looked  at  Samsung's \n phone  lineup  before  the  Edge,  you'd  run \n into  a  bit  of  a  block.  Now,  if  you're \n not  a  particularly  techy  consumer,  if \n you're  not  someone  who's  specifically \n looking  for  100  times  space  zoom  on  your \n camera  or  this  incredibly  advanced  smart \n pencil-like  experience  embedded  within \n the  phone,  then  you  don't  really  have \n any  incentive  to  spend  more  than  the \n £850  that  you  would  need  to  buy  an  S25 \n Plus.  that  might  actually  be  the  better \n phone  for  you  than  the  Ultra  because \n it's  just  slimmer  and  more  compact.  And \n so  I  think  the  reason  that  the  S25  Edge \n exists  is  to  create  an  alternate  path. \n You  want  to  spend  more,  you  don't  really \n crave  all  the  extra  tech  from  going  down \n the  Ultra  line.  So  this  allows  you  to \n spend  that  extra  on  style  instead.  Now, \n it  does  have  a  few  things  in  common  with \n the  Ultra,  like  it  still  has  the  same \n top-of-the-line  200  megapixel  camera \n that  only  Samsung's  Ultra  phones  have \n previously  had.  They  have  flattened  the \n lens  structure  to  keep  it  slim,  which \n does  seem  to  make  the  output  slightly \n softer  than  that  of  the  S25  Ultra.  I \n took  this  photo  like  six  times  and  every \n time  it  was  slightly  less  good,  but \n still  better  than  what  you  would  get  on \n an  S25  Plus.  Same  for  the  ultra  wide. \n While  the  quality  isn't  as  good  as  the \n ultras,  at least  this  ultrawide  does \n still  have  autofocus  like  that  one, \n which  means  you  can  also  use  it  for \n close-up  macro  shots.  This  ceramic  2 \n glass  on  the  front  is  similar  in \n strength  to  the  Ultra  and  stronger  than \n the  Victus  2  glass  that  you  get  on \n pretty  much  any  other  Samsung  phone.  And \n also  shout  out  to  this  realtime  visual \n AI  feature  which  has  come  out  since  the \n S25's  launch.  The  execution  isn't \n perfect,  but  the  concept  of  it  is \n insane.  So,  you  know  how  you  can  already \n do  realtime  chats  with  Gemini  using \n Gemini  Live?  This  is  like  that,  but  you \n can  now  also  be  on  a  video  call  with  it, \n which  means  things  like  you  can  pick  up \n a  coffee  maker,  for  example,  and  be \n like,  \"Is  this  where  I  put  the  beans?\" \n And  it  will  literally  look  at  where  your \n finger  is  pointing  and  say,  \"Yes,  but \n you  also  need  to  buy  a  filter,  I  can \n send  you  a  link  to  one  if  you  want.\" \n It's  really  cool  tech.  But  broadly \n speaking,  my  point  is  that  even  though \n price-wise  the  Edge  is  closer  to  an \n Ultra,  feature-  wise,  it's  way  closer  to \n the  Plus.  somewhat  similar  to  what \n happens  if  you  buy  one  of  Samsung's  Z \n flip  phones.  You're  paying  more  than \n what  you  would  be  for  one  of  Samsung's \n more  traditional  devices  for  an \n aesthetic,  a  vibe,  as  opposed  to \n actually  getting  better  tech.  And  so, \n the  way  that  I  see  this  S25  Edge  is  it's \n giving  people  another  option  for \n expression  if  that's  what  they  want,  but \n doesn't  involve  a  folding  phone,  which \n as  we've  seen  is  still  a  niche  thing \n that  not  everyone  wants.  And  to  be \n honest,  separate  to  whether  or  not  I'm \n going  to  recommend  this,  we're  getting \n there.  I  think  this  is  smart.  This  idea \n of  a  thin  premium  flagship  is  something \n that  I  think  we're  about  to  see  a  lot  of \n over  the  next  couple  of  years.  Apple's \n almost  definitely  about  to  do  it  later \n this  year.  Others  will  follow.  And  I  do \n think  that  there  are  plenty  of  customers \n out  there  who  are  going  to  find  this \n exciting  because  while  to  you  and  I  the \n idea  of  a  thin  phone  might  make  us \n think,  well,  didn't  we  try  that  10  years \n ago  and  didn't  it  like  not  work  at  all? \n Well,  I  think  it's  pretty  safe  to  say \n that  the  tech  community  is  going  to  be \n largely  against  thinness  at  all  costs \n because  of  the  durability  concerns  and \n the  fact  that  you  get  well  less  of  the \n tech.  There  are  still  two  things  that  I \n would  consider  in  the  S25  Edge's  favor. \n A  that  materials  are  a  lot  better  now \n than  they  used  to  be.  Like  this  is  going \n to  be  more  delicate  than  a  thicker \n phone,  but  it's  going  to  be  a  lot  less \n delicate  than  something  like  the  iPhone \n 6  Plus  from  back  in  the  day.  And  then  B \n is  just  that  if  you're  someone  who  cares \n a  bit  less  about  the  tech  in  2025,  which \n feels  more  likely  than  ever  before \n because  the  changes  in  the  tech  are \n becoming  harder  to  notice,  then  you  can \n so  see  how  the  option  to  buy  a  phone \n that's  just  straight  up  30%  thinner  is \n actually  going  to  feel  like  the  way  more \n noticeable  change  than  even  bigger \n camera  sensors,  even  faster  charging, \n even  brighter  screens,  you  know,  the \n usual  stuff  that  we  might  pay  more \n attention  to.  So  that's  why  I  think \n Samsung's  making  it.  But  it's  a  very \n different  question  as  to  whether  or  not \n you  should  buy  it.  I  would  say  this.  I \n think  it's  completely  fine  to  go  for  a \n cool  phone  at  the  cost  of  some \n functionality.  I  mean,  as  far  as  I'm \n concerned,  we  make  decisions  like  this \n all  the  time  with  the  clothes  we  wear, \n the  cars  we  drive,  the  bags  we  carry. \n You  don't  always  have  to  spec  optimize \n if  something  makes  you  happy.  Like,  this \n is  the  kind  of  phone  that  I'd  be  looking \n at,  and  my  first  thought  would  be,  \"Oh, \n my  mom,  she'd  love  this.\"  something \n that's  luxury  in  all  the  ways  that  she \n needs  it  to  be  while  cutting  out  all  the \n stuff  that  she  either  isn't  going  to \n know  or  isn't  going  to  care  about  to \n also  be  able  to  have  this  showstoppping \n thinness.  However,  there  are  two  things \n that  would  make  me  very  nervous  to \n recommend  this.  One  is  the  great  case \n dilemma.  It's  this  really \n counterintuitive  thing  where  if  you're \n buying  an  ultra  thin  phone  like  this, \n then  you'd  probably  want  a  proper \n hardbacked  thick  case  more  than  ever. \n But  then  if  you  put  a  proper  hardbacked \n thicked  case  on,  you're  then  defeating \n half  the  point  of  sacrificing  all  these \n features  to  have  a  thinner  phone. \n Wouldn't  it  just  be  better  at  that  point \n to  go  for  a  thicker  phone  that  is \n stronger  and  more  featurerich  and  then \n have  a  thinner  case?  And  then  the  second \n even  bigger  issue  really  is  the  battery \n size.  Because  while  I  do  think  that \n chopping  out  pro  features  like  telephoto \n cameras  and  S  Pens  is  actually \n completely  justified  because  there  are \n so  many  people  who  just  will  not  even \n touch  them.  I  wouldn't  put  battery  in \n that  same  category.  I  think  the  vast \n vast  majority  of  people  no  matter  how \n techy  they  are  would  benefit  from  a  big \n battery.  Like  mom  if  we're  using  that \n example,  she  has  never  once  complained \n about  camera  quality  with  her  last  few \n phones.  But  she  absolutely  runs  into \n battery  issues.  It's  probably  like  the \n one  single  spec  that  unites  us  all.  And \n so  the  idea  of  paying  that  ultra  premium \n price  for  a  phone  with  a  battery  that's \n not  even  just  average,  but  actually \n small  by  today's  standards  is  not \n something  that  I  would  be  rushing  out  to \n do.  They  do  say  it's  all  day  battery, \n but  generally  with  phone  companies,  what \n that  actually  means  is  don't  think  about \n it  too  much.  If  this  was  a  more  energy \n dense  silicon  carbon  battery,  this  would \n be  a  different  conversation.  But  it \n isn't.  Which  means  I  think  it's  likely \n within  a  few  years  of  using  this  when \n the  honeymoon  phase  of  going  for \n something  suave  has  run  dry  and  the \n battery  has  degraded  that  you  might \n regret  prioritizing  thinness.  That  is  if \n you  haven't  already  snapped  the  thing  by \n then.  And  now,  while  I  show  you  the \n camera  in  action,  one  thing  that  I've \n been  massively  appreciating  about  my  own \n phone  recently  is  the  stark  drop  off  in \n junk  calls  and  spam  emails.  You  get  them \n because  every  freaking  service  nowadays \n from  your  supermarket  to  that  Wi-Fi \n login  at  the  weird  back  street  cafe  that \n you  went  to  once  wants  you  to  create  an \n account,  fill  in  every  detail  about  you \n to  be  able  to  reach  you  in  as  many  ways \n as  possible.  And  the  more  times  that  you \n hand  that  data  out,  the  more  likely  it \n is  that  it's  going  to  end  up  in  the \n hands  of  bad  actors.  So  if  you're  like \n me,  splashing  out  your  details  ever \n since  the  day  you  signed  up  to  Neopets \n in  2002,  there's  going  to  be  a  lot.  So, \n I  started  using  Incogn,  our  sponsor,  in \n 2023.  It's  kind  of  like  the  Liam  Niss  of \n data  privacy.  It  finds  the  people  who \n took  your  data  and  it  politely  insists \n that  they  take  it  down.  It  handles  any \n follow-ups  and  legal  bits  that  may  come \n with  that.  And  to  be  honest,  I  think  the \n best  part  of  it  is  the  custom  removals. \n You  know,  those  times  when  you  Google \n yourself  and  you  find  a  little  bit  more \n personal  information  than  you  wanted  to \n share.  Here,  you  can  just  ping  the  link \n to \n Incogn.  So  link  below  to  get  incogn \n which  with  the  code  boss  you  can  get  for \n a  60%  discount.",
