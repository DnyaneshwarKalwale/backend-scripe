  "transcript": "I'm  about  to  show  you  the  best  oneperson \n business  that  can  make  you  six  figures \n from  home.  Last  year,  I  made  over \n $100,000  doing  this,  and  I  didn't  even \n need  a  website.  Not  to  mention,  prior  to \n that,  I  had  no  job,  no  big  connections, \n and  I  didn't  even  need  my  degree  at  all. \n Look,  every  year  there's  a  new \n opportunity  for  regular  people  to  make \n millions  of  dollars  online.  You  just \n need  to  know  where  to  look.  The \n opportunity  I'm  seeing  right  now  is  on \n LinkedIn,  but  not  in  the  way  you  think. \n While  most  people  use  LinkedIn  to  find \n jobs,  you  are  going  to  use  it  to  start  a \n oneperson  business.  And  you're  going  to \n use  the  exact  same  system  people  like \n Justin  Welsh,  Matt  Gray,  and  I  have  used \n to  make  millions  of  dollars  from \n LinkedIn  this  year  alone.  Now,  this \n opportunity  is  working  for  us  right  now \n because  no  one  is  talking  about  it.  But \n trust  me  when  I  say  this,  this  won't \n last  forever.  So,  in  this  video,  I'm \n going  to  show  you  the  exact  three-step \n process  you  can  follow  to  turn  your \n LinkedIn  profile  into  a  oneperson \n business.  And  it  all  starts  with  phase \n number  one,  which  is  exactly  where  you \n are  right  now.  Currently,  either  stuck \n in  your  current  job  or  looking  for  the \n freedom  to  do  whatever  you  want, \n whenever  you  want,  with  whoever  you \n want.  And  this  isn't  about  starting  a \n big  business.  Forget  about  that  right \n now  because  that's  exactly  what's \n stopping  you.  The  idea  of  becoming \n slaved  once  again  to  something  you  might \n hate.  While  I  was  working  a  9  to5  or \n more  like  doing  7  to  eight  at  that  point \n doing  doortodoor,  the  last  thing  I \n wanted  to  do  was  think  about  spending  my \n savings  on  developing  a  business  idea. \n And  if  you're  watching  this  right  now, \n you've  probably  seen  the  multiple  other \n videos  where  they  give  you  a  business \n idea  for  you  to  try  and  get  your  own \n dream  life  or  financial  time  and \n location  freedom.  But  every  time  I  went \n down  this  route,  it  paralyzed  me  and \n inevitably  I  failed  and  lost  money.  I \n tried  to  become  a  social  media  manager \n using  Tik  Tok,  Pinterest  and  Facebook \n and  even  Instagram  and  even  tried  the \n ultimate  fast  cash  business  model,  drop \n shipping,  after  seeing  multiple  Tik  Tok \n videos  from  people  living  in  luxurious \n locations  with  ideal  lifestyles  just \n working  4  hours  a  day.  But  the  problem \n here,  just  like  the  9to-5  you're  trying \n to  escape,  is  that  you're  assigned  this \n business  by  someone  else  without \n thinking  about  your  idea  of  what  your \n passion  and  interests  look  like  as  a  way \n to  achieve  your  ideal  life.  And  I'm  not \n here  to  overwhelm  you  with  the  idea  of \n full-time  entrepreneurship.  I'm  going  to \n go  through  the  three-step  process  I  used \n instead  because  you  don't  need  the \n perfect  business  model  to  copy  and  paste \n to  get  started.  You  actually  just  need \n to  do  one  thing.  Get  attention.  And \n today  you  can  do  that  for  free  and  fast \n using  LinkedIn.  Normal  people  like  you \n and  me  are  gaining  thousands  and  even \n millions  of  eyes  on  their  profiles  right \n now  using  the  platform.  LinkedIn  has \n changed  a  lot  over  the  last  few  years. \n And  it's  no  longer  just  for  job  seekers \n or  updating  your  job  status  for  your  100 \n connections  from  your  work.  But  we  can \n use  this  common  belief  to  our  advantage \n and  get  ahead  of  the  99%  of  the  1 \n billion  users  by  writing  on  the \n platform.  It's  free.  It's  simple.  and \n there  is  little  to  no  competition.  But \n in  order  to  truly  succeed  at  doing  this \n fast,  you  need  to  learn  how  to  write  and \n be  able  to  become  valuable  to  other \n people.  You'll  be  surprised  how  valuable \n a  simple,  well-written,  step-by-step \n tutorial  on  something  you  already  know \n is  to  someone  else.  The  fact  that  you're \n even  watching  this  video  right  now \n proves  my  point.  There  is  value  here \n through  me  helping  you  bridge  a \n knowledge  gap,  and  you  can  do  the  same \n no  matter  what  your  experience  level  is. \n Now,  when  it  comes  to  what  you're  going \n to  write  about,  the  answer  is  simple. \n What  is  the  skill  that  you  can  teach? \n Forget  about  being  an  expert  right  now \n and  focus  on  finding  the  one  thing  you \n could  potentially  be  an  expert  in  in  the \n future.  List  down  everything  you \n currently  know  and  that  you  have \n experience  in.  And  I  made  you  a  list  of \n questions  to  help  you  get  started.  What \n are  personal  achievements  of  yours  where \n you've  had  significant  transformations? \n What  have  you  learned  to  do  in  a  unique \n way  without  following  a  regular  process? \n What  are  current  hobbies  that  you  have \n that  can  be  turned  into  high  value \n skills  you  can  use  to  build  something  on \n top  of?  You  need  to  build  on  top  of  what \n you  already  know  or  like  to  do  in  order \n for  this  to  actually  work  for  you. \n Otherwise,  you'll  build  yourself  a \n second  jail  where  you're  stuck  writing \n about  things  you're  going  to  hate  in  a \n few  months.  You  don't  need  to  be  an \n expert  in  any  of  these  things  you  want \n to  talk  about.  You  just  need  to  be \n interested  enough  to  be  of  service  to \n someone  else.  Aim  to  become  a \n professional  problem  solver,  even  if \n it's  a  tiny  problem.  Because  the  faster \n you  solve  tiny  problem  one  while  writing \n and  building  a  tiny  audience  interested \n in  that  one  thing,  the  faster  you  can \n move  on  to  step  number  two  of  the \n process,  validation.  Textbased  platforms \n like  LinkedIn  and  even  X  give  you  the \n advantage  to  quickly  understand  and \n validate  whether  your  current  skill  or \n interest  has  market  demand.  You  don't \n even  need  to  leave  your  house  or  spend \n any  money  to  try.  All  you  need  to  do  is \n create  content  three,  five,  or  even \n seven  times  a  week.  And  from  that  alone, \n you  can  get  enough  data  points  to \n improve  and  double  down  or  completely \n remove  from  your  content.  And  this  is \n exactly  how  we're  currently  blowing  up \n students  and  clients  on  LinkedIn  right \n now  via  a  validation  process.  And  it's \n also  how  I  got  started.  Think  about  it \n like  making  food.  You  cook  it,  you  try \n it,  and  test  different  ingredients  to \n see  what  suits  the  dish  best.  more \n water,  less  water,  more  salt.  You  test \n it,  like  it,  give  it  to  someone  else, \n they  like  it,  and  boom,  you  have  a  10 \n out  of  10  recipe  you  can  share,  right? \n Writing  content  is  essentially  the  same. \n Based  on  step  number  one,  I  wrote  about \n multiple  different  things,  not  even \n knowing  what  my  niche  was.  I  had  no \n niche  and  no  idea,  just  a  hunch  that  I \n needed  to  start  building  something  of  my \n own.  I  never  went  into  writing  content \n on  LinkedIn  being  like,  \"Yep,  so  I'm \n going  to  be  the  marketing  and  personal \n brand  girl  and  I'm  going  to  build \n businesses  on  top  of  that  and  yes,  that \n I'm  going  to  do  all  of  these  other \n things.\"  No,  I  literally  was  writing  on \n the  platform  waiting  to  get  either  a  job \n offer  from  someone  and  trying  to  make  my \n profile  look  nice  for  when  recruiters \n checked  my  applications  out.  My  one  and \n only  goal  was  to  stop  being  unemployed, \n but  it  turned  out  to  be  better  than  I \n could  ever  imagine.  And  personally,  I \n think  that's  why  I  found  success  so \n rapidly  because  I  wasn't  being \n self-interest  about  gatekeeping \n information  and  I  wrote  about  everything \n and  anything  I  knew  and  even  what  I \n learned  and  was  learning.  So  when  you're \n writing  about  your  interests  and  start \n becoming  curious  about  them  even  more, \n you  can  attract  an  audience  around  these \n interests  and  as  a  result  you  can  build \n a  business  serving  them.  This  idea  I \n pulled  from  Naval  Ravikhan's  teachings. \n When  I  joined  LinkedIn,  I  saw  some \n people  doing  this  and  now  they  have \n dozens  of  followers  and  businesses  that \n need  no  employees  that  started  from  the \n single  interest  and  a  tiny  problem.  Now, \n for  you  to  do  the  same,  you  need  to  find \n the  interest  that  seem  valuable  and \n teachable  to  you.  Write  about  the \n lessons  you  learned  and  implemented \n while  reading  a  business  book.  Give  your \n opinions  on  trends  that  are  working  on \n social  media  right  now.  And  write  about \n your  journey  of  achieving  small  and  big \n wins  via  different  frameworks  or  systems \n that  you  might  find  online.  I'm  leaving \n one  example  for  each  so  you  can \n visualize  these  posts  and  get  full \n context.  I  wrote  about  the  few  interests \n I  had  that  seemed  valuable  and \n teachable.  So,  book  reviews,  SEO  and \n social  media  as  a  whole,  writing  tips  I \n was  learning,  and  personal  stories  that \n felt  relevant  to  share  to  a  B2B \n audience.  Within  a  few  weeks  of  trying \n all  of  these  ideas  out,  I  found  a  few \n signals  where  the  market  told  me  what  it \n wanted  me  to  teach  about.  And  this  came \n in  the  form  of  this  thing  that  I  call \n traffic  allocation.  On  LinkedIn,  the \n traffic  distribution  was  clear  via \n follower  and  engagement  growth.  Every \n time  I  would  write  about  SEO,  arts  or \n influencer  marketing,  my  content  would \n flop.  But  whenever  I  spoke  about \n branding  and  writing  frameworks  I  was \n testing  live  and  pair  them  using \n storytelling  to  emphasize  my  points  even \n further,  I  would  go  viral  nearly  every \n single  time.  But  I  had  to  test  different \n interests  that  were  slightly  adjacent  to \n each  other  to  find  my  one  thing.  Pairing \n your  hobbies  with  a  tangible  skill  you \n can  teach  and  writing  every  single  week \n on  LinkedIn  about  it  will  help  you  speed \n up  the  process  of  finding  the  validation \n that  you  need  as  well  as  your  first \n unfair  advantage  to  double  down  on. \n Finding  it  is  easy  when  you're  testing \n at  scale  and  hence  why  writing  is  the \n most  valuable  thing  you  can  do  right \n now.  It's  free.  It's  simple.  And  all  you \n need  to  do  is  commit  to  creating \n outstanding  content  every  single  time. \n And  for  that  to  happen,  your  content \n needs  to  be  better  than  anyone's  paid \n content.  I  made  a  full  video  on  how  to \n take  your  interest  and  turn  it  into \n content  that  grows  your  account.  And  a \n full  video  on  the  seven  LinkedIn  laws \n you  need  to  follow  to  succeed.  So,  make \n sure  you  check  them  out  after  you  watch \n this  video.  Now,  moving  on.  Step  number \n three  is  turning  your  attention  into \n something  you  can  earn.  While  LinkedIn \n is  free,  which  is  why  it  is  the  best \n place  to  start  and  build  an  insanely \n engaged  audience,  you  need  to  learn  how \n to  take  that  following  and  own  it \n yourself  without  relying  on  social  media \n to  give  it  to  you.  Because \n realistically,  only  around  1  to  10%  of \n your  audience  only  get  to  actually  see \n your  content.  The  way  we're  going  to  own \n it  is  by  simply  building  a  newsletter \n where  you're  not  tied  to  an  algorithm  or \n even  forced  to  create  content  every \n single  day  to  maintain  that  connection \n with  your  audience.  I  honestly  wish  I \n did  this  sooner,  but  personally,  I \n didn't  even  see  the  opportunity  there. \n But  now,  like  70  to  80%  of  my  revenue \n comes  from  email.  It  has  20x  my  ability \n to  make  money  through  my  personal \n brands.  But  I  didn't  see  the  opportunity \n because  the  only  emails  I  used  to  get \n were  either  from  My  Protein  or  Gym  Shark \n telling  me  that  there  was  a  flash  sale \n for  the  first  time  ever  for  the  third \n time  that  month  or  university  or  work \n emails  I  would  be  happy  not  receiving. \n But  back  in  2023,  I  was  preparing  to \n have  my  first  ever  public  product \n launch.  Until  then,  I'd  never  offered \n anything  to  my  audience.  I  had  been \n focusing  on  doing  what  I  outlined  on \n phase  number  one,  finding  a  skill  that  I \n was  good  at,  created  content  about  it, \n validated  it,  solved  other  people's \n problems  through  it,  and  had  built  my \n first  business,  LA  Digital,  where  I  was \n ghostwriting  on  LinkedIn.  I'll  get  into \n detail  about  this  later  in  the  video,  by \n the  way.  But  I  had  never  ever  publicly \n promoted  myself  very  much.  I  was \n monetizing  my  personal  brand  via  inbound \n inquiries  as  I  had  a  highly  optimized \n profile  that  converted  enough  traffic \n for  me.  I  also  made  a  full  video \n breakdown  on  this  so  you  can  watch  it \n later  here.  While  figuring  out  a  launch \n plan  for  my  new  coaching  program,  one  of \n my  good  friends,  Dakota  Robertson,  told \n me  to  start  an  email  list,  who  by  the \n way,  I'm  trying  to  beat  on  a  race  to \n 100K  on  YouTube.  So,  if  you  can  please \n subscribe  to  my  channel,  I  love  you \n forever.  Anyways,  here's  the  rundown  on \n email  and  why  I'm  all  in  on  it.  You \n basically  own  100%  of  the  contacts  on \n your  list,  which  makes  it  one  of  the \n most  valuable  resources  you  can  build \n because  you  aren't  relying  on  consistent \n content  and  the  perfect  hooks.  I  set \n mine  up  on  Beehive,  which  in  my  opinion \n is  the  best  newsletter  platform  for \n beginners.  The  layout  is  super  clear  and \n simple,  and  it's  free  to  start,  so  it's \n basically  a  no-brainer.  Then  I  started \n writing  an  email  a  week,  expanding  on \n content  pieces  I  already  had  written  as \n short  form  content  on  LinkedIn.  This \n gave  me  so  much  more  depth  and  built  a \n closer  relationship  with  my  audience  as \n they  got  to  read  a  slightly  more  honest \n and  less  polished  version  of  me.  And \n this  is  what  some  gurus  would  call \n authenticity.  And  I  just  simply  call  it \n being  honest.  Like  my  best  email  was  an \n email  I  wrote  about  Harry  Potter.  I \n don't  know.  The  reason  why  we  didn't \n start  here  is  because  growing  a \n newsletter  combines  my  two  favorite \n things  as  a  creator.  Validated  content \n and  leverage.  Leverage,  for  those  who \n don't  know,  has  become  one  of  my \n favorite  words.  And  what  it  means  is \n achieving  outsiz  results  with  minimal \n effort.  And  by  now,  you  stacked  up  the \n reps  writing  and  posting  contents.  You \n validated  the  content  that  works.  And  in \n that  time,  you  build  leverage  through \n creating  content  on  LinkedIn,  giving  you \n authority  and  a  following  of  people  who \n like  you,  know  you,  and  trust  you.  That \n is  the  power  of  free  content.  To  then \n use  it  to  convert  it  into  traffic  to \n your  newsletter,  you  need  to  double  down \n on  the  free  stuff.  You  need  to  create  a \n free  and  downloadable  resource  and \n promote  it  via  your  content  on  LinkedIn. \n Don't  try  to  reinvent  the  wheel  with \n this.  There  are  multiple  proven  formats \n for  this.  Free  Notion  toolkits \n streamlining  a  process  or  sharing  a \n framework.  A  10-page  long  Google \n document  outlining  a  step-by-step \n process.  Long  Loom  explainer  tutorials \n taking  people  from  problem  to  solution. \n Getting  the  idea  for  yours  can  actually \n come  from  your  content  that  perform \n best,  which  you  can  actually  then \n repackage  into  one  free  resource  you  can \n share.  You  can  also  get  the  idea  from \n questions  you  get  from  your  followers  or \n even  clients  and  make  a  quick  resource \n for  this  as  well.  Or  you  can  use \n Stanto's  Stanley  AI  which  I  have  been \n nerding  out  on  and  it's  so  good.  I've \n just  created  a  free  email  miniourse  with \n them.  So  check  it  out  in  the  description \n as  it  has  a  full  Stanley  AI  tutorial  in \n one  of  the  emails.  I've  done  this  in  the \n past  where  I've  made  lead  magnets  with \n AI  prompts  to  help  other  people  write \n and  swipe  files  for  other  people  to  get \n inspiration  from.  Now  you  don't  need  a \n fancy  and  expensive  website  to  get \n started  with  this  either.  Platforms  like \n Standtore  have  become  an  all-in-one \n solution  for  creators  wanting  to  make \n their  first  online  dollar  and  monetize \n their  social  media.  And  fun  fact,  this \n is  exactly  where  I  hosted  my  first  ever \n lead  magnet  back  in  2022  while  I  was \n figuring  everything  out  and  had  no  money \n to  invest  on  building  a  website  or \n hiring  people  to  help.  Here's  how  it \n works.  So,  step  number  one,  you  need  to \n name  and  upload  your  resource  onto \n Stanol.  Mine  is  a  full  LinkedIn  playbook \n giving  away  every  single  thing  I  know \n about  how  to  grow  and  monetize.  I  set \n the  price  to  zero  and  it  will \n automatically  add  a  section  for  people \n to  add  their  name  and  email  address. \n Now,  step  number  two  is  customizing  your \n landing  page  using  the  different  free \n themes  they  have  and  add  relevant \n details  like  your  name,  a  headline,  and \n your  LinkedIn  for  credibility.  Now,  step \n number  three  is  get  your  personalized \n Stanto  link  so  you  can  share  it  on \n LinkedIn.  I  actually  partnered  up  with \n Stanto  today  to  create  this  video  for \n you  and  they've  extended  their  usual \n 15-day  trial  to  30  days  for  you  to  help \n you  make  your  first  online  dollar  using \n Stanto  and  LinkedIn.  You  can  find  the \n link  to  sign  up  below  and  again  the \n miniourse  we  created  for  you.  Now,  I'm \n going  to  reveal  the  secret  lead  magnet \n framework  that  got  me  my  first  5,000 \n subscribers  in  less  than  24  hours.  I \n call  it  the  give,  give,  ask  framework. \n You  give  people  enough  free  content  to \n generate  attention.  You  give  people  a \n lot  more  free  value  to  get  them  excited. \n You  then  ask  them  for  their  email  so  you \n can  sell  to  them  over  time.  The  most \n straightforward  way  is  through  a \n LinkedIn  post,  but  not  just  a  regular \n post.  Let  me  break  down  the  architecture \n of  my  winning  one.  First,  we  start  with \n the  written  copy  of  it.  The  first  line, \n the  hook  needs  to  highlight  a  desire  or \n soul.  The  hook  here  is  want  to  grow  your \n LinkedIn.  99%  of  people  would  say  yes. \n Then  the  second  line  or  the  rehook  needs \n to  create  desire.  For  mine,  I \n immediately  twisted  it  by  giving  them \n something  they  didn't  expect  without \n spending  x  amount  of  money,  validated \n their  problem,  showed  them  I  could  solve \n them,  and  used  specific  language  to \n position  it.  Within  the  first  3  seconds, \n I  got  you  hooked  with  value  and  my \n ability  to  solve  your  burning  problem. \n And  then  I  offered  the  resource  and \n reminded  them  that  it  was  going  to  be \n free.  The  hack  here  is  to  add  urgency. \n Most  people  don't  take  action  because \n they  think  they  have  time.  You  need  to \n remove  that  from  the  equation  to  get \n them  to  act  fast.  Just  like  I  did  in \n this  post  here.  The  last  thing,  and  most \n importantly,  you  need  to  remove \n friction.  Don't  make  them  ask  for  the \n resource.  If  your  objective  is  growth, \n give  it  to  them  as  fast  as  possible.  So \n in  this  section  here  is  where  you  add \n the  direct  link  to  your  lead  magnet. \n This  is  also  why  I  really  like  Stanto  as \n a  beginner  because  I  spent  weeks \n learning  how  to  create  a  landing  page \n and  buying  domains  for  the  landing  page \n and  all  the  lead  magnets.  But  Stanto \n does  it  for  you.  People  should  be  able \n to  immediately  go  from  post  to  your \n landing  page  to  download  it  in  literally \n three  steps.  Now  a  bonus  tip  is  to \n always  try  and  pair  this  type  of  post \n with  a  visual.  I  used  a  clear  graphic  of \n what  growth  looked  like  to  emphasize \n what  the  lead  magnet  was  about.  Making  a \n resource  tangible  and  double  or  triple \n down  your  conversions.  I  love  the  way \n Justin  Walsh  does  his,  by  the  way,  where \n the  digital  product  looks  like  physical \n ones,  making  it  desirable.  You  can  also \n do  these  types  of  post  every  single  week \n to  grow  your  list.  Now,  phase  number \n three  is  monetization.  Here's  where \n you're  going  to  be  trading  your  skills \n for  money.  There  are  three  ways  you  can \n do  it.  do-it-yourself  offers,  so  digital \n products,  do  it  with  you  offers,  so \n coaching  and  programs,  and  done  for  you \n offers,  so  full-time  implementation  of \n services  like  ghostwriting.  I  started \n with  the  latter,  done  for  you  offers, \n which  in  my  opinion  is  the  ultimate  way \n to  get  good  at  your  skill,  make  money \n from  it,  and  then  build  an  audience \n through  it.  You  get  to  prove  to  yourself \n that  you  can  do  the  thing.  You  get  to \n build  social  proof  that  you  can  do  it \n for  others,  and  you  get  to  use  both  of \n those  things  to  create  more  content.  You \n literally  build  a  content  machine  that \n moves  the  needle  for  you  without  needing \n endless  strategies.  Because  when  you \n have  clients  relying  on  you  to  deliver, \n you  can't  afford  to  land  in  education \n procrastination  land  and  watch  endless \n tutorials  that  you  never  get  to \n implement.  You  actually  need  to  do  the \n thing.  And  if  you  can't  do  it,  then  you \n go  and  learn  it  and  then  implement  it  to \n get  results  for  your  clients.  This  is \n like  the  reverse  of  the  current \n education  system,  but  you  actually  make \n money  and  build  a  life  you  enjoy.  And \n yes,  it  is  possible.  To  give  you  some \n context  on  how  this  works  as  well,  I \n started  charging  around  $500  for  a \n month's  worth  of  ghost  writing  and \n strategy.  It  started  with  an  inbound \n lead  I  got  from  LinkedIn  when  I  first \n started  writing  about  my  interests.  The \n lead  wanted  me  to  simply  apply  my \n learnings  to  their  content  strategy  on \n LinkedIn.  All  I  had  to  do  was  name  a \n price  and  figure  out  the  rest  later.  The \n offer  was  simple.  I  will  write  x  amount \n of  posts  for  you.  Build  a  strategy  and \n grow  your  following.  simple,  attractive, \n and  attainable.  Then  I  raised  my  prices \n by  $200  to  $300  each  time  until  I \n started  charging  around  $3  to  $5,000  a \n month  for  the  exact  same  service. \n Obviously,  I  had  more  experience  and \n results  which  I  leveraged.  Now,  after \n doing  done  for  you  for  a  while  and \n validating  your  service,  you  might  find \n patterns,  common  questions,  and  mistakes \n people  you  want  to  work  with  make.  And \n this  is  the  best  opportunity  for  you  to \n productize  your  knowledge.  Your  first \n digital  product,  you  build  it  once,  you \n sell  it  infinite  times,  and  then \n integrate  it  as  you  gain  more  knowledge. \n So,  if  you're  a  fitness  coach  and  you  do \n live  PT  and  online  training,  then  the \n simplest  digital  product  would  be  an \n 8week  summer  shred  program  people  can \n download.  But  yes,  there's  already \n plenty  of  those  out  there,  even  for \n free.  However,  let's  say  you  have  a  lot \n more  experience  working  with  women  who \n have  hormonal  imbalances  and  run  a \n business.  Now,  your  digital  product  can \n be  an  8-week  workout  program  to  reduce \n stress  and  control  your  hormones  for \n women.  The  trick  here  isn't  the \n specificity  of  your  resource  because \n yes,  the  riches  are  in  the  niches.  And \n of  course,  you  get  better  results,  too. \n So,  it's  a  win-win.  You  can  create  a \n mini  video  course  solving  that  one \n problem.  You  can  create  a  notion  system \n or  you  can  make  a  1hour  tutorial  on  Loom \n or  on  Zoom.  Whatever  gets  people  the \n answers  to  the  problem  works.  Now \n lastly,  done  with  you  offers  like \n onetoone  coaching  or  programs  or  even \n communities.  You  can  take  everything  you \n productize  in  your  mini  products  and \n then  expand  into  the  specifics  of  each \n thing  which  is  something  that  is  highly \n demanded.  People  don't  just  pay  for  the \n products,  they  also  pay  for  the  people \n making  these  products.  They  want  to \n learn  directly  from  you.  They  want  the \n specific  tricks  that  you  use  or  most  of \n the  times  they  just  relate  to  you  the \n most  out  of  everyone  else  in  the \n industry.  So  they  are  biased  to  want  you \n as  their  coach  which  again  is  why \n creating  content  is  literally  the \n highest  value  skill.  If  you  want  to \n build  a  one-to-one  coaching  offer, \n here's  how  you  do  it.  You  can  charge \n people  for  a  1-hour  call  plus  the \n recordings  and  perhaps  some  bonus \n templates  and  resources.  Then  you  solve \n their  problems  on  the  call  and  show  them \n your  process.  You  can  then  package  that \n offer  into  a  larger  package  where  people \n can  buy  multiple  calls  with  you.  For \n this,  it's  best  to  have  an  outline  of \n what  every  single  call  would  be  about. \n Someone  who's  done  this  very  well  is \n Jasmine  Alich  on  LinkedIn  outlining \n what's  included  in  every  single  session \n and  what  they  get  if  they  buy  four  calls \n instead  of  just  one.  This  is  a  great \n template  for  anyone  who's  trying  to  do \n the  same.  Now,  as  you  compound  attention \n and  validate  your  skill  and  create  your \n own  mechanism  to  get  to  a  result,  you \n can  also  build  a  community,  a  program  or \n a  mastermind  where  people  can  pay  a \n monthly  or  yearly  access  to  you.  Here's \n how  you  do  it.  You  get  all  of  the \n questions,  your  done  for  you  and  done \n with  you  clients  have  asked.  Then  you \n create  video  content  to  these  problems, \n giving  them  the  solutions.  Then  you  put \n it  on  a  platform  like  standtore  so \n people  can  consume  the  information.  The \n value  add  from  communities  and  programs \n are  the  live  call  elements  where  people \n get  to  see  you  once  a  week  or  maybe \n twice  a  month.  I  call  these  live  master \n classes  or  Q&A  inside  of  my  community \n literally  academy  where  I  talk  to \n members  every  single  week  in  a  Q&A \n format  or  a  masterclass  format  and  even \n have  guest  master  classes.  The  best  part \n about  this  is  that  you  get  to  build  your \n own  feedback  loop  with  real  people.  They \n ask  you  questions  that  you  can  create \n content  around  and  even  a  better  product \n on.  And  you  also  build  a  community  of \n people  who  are  bought  into  you  and  the \n mission.  You  get  to  teach  those  behind \n you  and  even  learn  from  those  ahead.  If \n you  want  to  join  mine  with  over  600 \n members  building  their  personal  brand  on \n LinkedIn,  I'll  drop  mine  below,  but  you \n can  also  follow  me  on  LinkedIn  where \n there  is  an  active  community  of \n like-minded  people  in  the  comment \n section  as  well.  Now,  using  the  three \n pillars  I  just  taught  you,  content  to \n get  attention,  traffic  to  get  people \n trusting  you,  and  then  monetizing,  you \n have  a  full  system  from  how  to  go  from \n zero  to  your  first  oneperson  business. \n All  of  this  without  having  to  hire \n employees  or  paying  for  a  crazy  and \n expensive  website.  Now,  I  want  to  end \n with  something,  and  this  is  probably  the \n most  valuable  lesson  when  building  your \n oneperson  business.  The  process  of \n building  your  oneperson  business  is  a \n lot  more  than  just  money.  It's  also \n about  proximity.  The  people  you  get  to \n meet  in  this  journey  can  also  become \n mentors,  coaches,  and  even  friends  who \n will  solve  your  problems  without  you \n needing  to  pay  them.  But  to  achieve \n this,  you  need  to  become  useful.  And  you \n do  this  via  your  content  and  results. \n You  trade  your  knowledge  for  knowledge \n and  ultimately  become  an  asset  to \n someone.  And  this  is  just  the  start. \n Challenge  yourself  to  do  this  for  the \n next  90  days  and  prove  everyone  wrong. \n I'll  see  you  in  the  next",
