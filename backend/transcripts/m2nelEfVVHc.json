  "transcript": "Yo,  what's  up?  It's  your  boy  KSI.  Uh, \n today  we're  doing  a  Reddit.  Filming  this \n just  before  I  head  over  to  New  York \n because  I'm  doing  certain  things.  Before \n I  begin  the  Reddit,  Misfits  21,  May  the \n 16th.  Your  boy  will  be  there.  Uh,  it's \n in  Derby.  Be  sure  to  be  there.  Get  your \n tickets  or  watch  it  for  free  on  the \n zone.  All right,  let's  go.  I  saw  KSI  out \n on  a  jog  today.  Oh,  what's  this?  I  might \n I  think  I  remember  the  guy  to  there's \n quite  a  few  people  who  I  see  whenever  I \n go  on  my  runs. \n How  are  you,  bro?  I'm  good.  Respect, \n man.  Lovely  day.  I'm  a  big  fan,  bro. \n Appreciate  it,  man.  Love,  bro. \n You  know,  okay,  you \n are  you  okay?  So,  you \n know,  I  know  you  shout  out  to  the  guy, \n man.  He  was  he  was  very  nice.  He  said \n what's  up  and  then,  you  know,  let  me \n continue  my  run.  Uh,  I  get  it  a  lot \n whenever  I  go  on  runs.  Uh,  normally  I \n like  to  run  outside  because,  you  know, \n the  weather  is  nice  or  it  just  feels \n better  running  outside  as  opposed  to \n running  on  a  treadmill,  which  can  be  a \n bit  boring.  And  especially  in  gyms  these \n days,  it's  just  so  busy.  So,  being  able \n to  run  the  fresh  air,  ah,  it's  just  ah, \n it's  just  beautiful.  But  yeah,  I  get \n recognized  quite  a  bit  whenever  I  go  on \n my  runs.  It's  funny  like  normally  people \n recognize  me  as  I  pass  them  by  the  time \n they  realize  they're  like  oh  my  god  KSI \n and  then  they're  like  am  I  going  to  jog \n to  get  to  him  and  most  people  just  can't \n be  asked  but  some  people \n do  but  honestly  I've  never  had  a  bad \n encounter.  Everyone's  always  been  nice. \n So  uh  yeah,  shout  out  this  guy.  I'm \n looking  kind  of  big  as  well.  Jeez.  Oh \n skinny  waist  but  big \n chest.  I'm  a  big  boy.  Big  boy  but  not \n fat.  Sidemen  20,000  door  versus  $20 \n door.  That  is  a  stinker.  That  is  a  10 \n out  of  10.  Terrible,  terrible  video \n idea.  Did  JJ  get \n shorter?  Oh  my  god,  what  a  stream.  For \n those  of  you  that  don't  know,  I  did  a \n stream  with  Speed.  Uh,  it  was  it  was \n interesting.  Very  interesting.  Some  very \n funny  moments,  some  weird  weird  moments. \n And  then  we  did  FIFA  with  a  belt.  Yes,  I \n know  some  of  you  like  to  call  it \n something  else,  but  uh  we  played  FIFA \n with  a  belt  and  uh  yeah.  H  lots  of  pain, \n lots  of  goals,  lots  of  pain.  When  is  the \n door  giveaway?  Yep.  Kill  yourself.  Can \n you  give  away  a  door  made  of  cotton? \n 12inut  mark.  It's  a  really  clever  term. \n Can  we  just  stop  talking  about  this \n [ __ ]  door?  Hey,  I'm  very  excited  for \n the  door  giveaway,  but  I'm  curious.  I'm \n curious  what  type.  I'm  quite  the \n mahogany  guy  myself.  Why  don't  you  put \n some  mahogany  up  your  [ __ ]  arm?  JJ, \n my  door  was  stolen,  bro.

We've  been  waiting,  guys. \n Honestly,  I  don't  even  know  what \n Celestia  Vega  is  even  doing  these  days. \n This  was  seven  years  ago.  I  don't  know \n what  she  does  or  where  she  is.  It's  not \n happening.  Stop.  Stop,  guys.

Fantastic.  Arian \n saw  JJ's  reaction  to  his  vid.  Bro  got  so \n hyped  he  put  on  the  Forier  fight,  which \n he  also  has  memorized.  His  public  insert \n is  at  playboy  cries.  Okay,  wait,  let  me \n see  this. \n Imagine  he  reacts  to  it.  He's  like,  \"Guy \n needs  to  get  a  job,  bro. \n This  is  the  greatest  of  my  life.  Let's \n go.\"  He  doesn't  think  I'm  autistic. \n Let's  go. \n Whatever.  I  told  you. \n He  [ __ ]  made  it.  What  one  do  you  have \n to  like  memorize  the  best? \n Three  fights.  See,  the  thing  is  I  don't \n just  know  the  fight  one.  I  know  the \n press  conference,  the  face  off.  I  know \n the  open  workout.  This  guy's  so  excited. \n He  put \n [Music] \n on  Hey, \n the  switch  steps. \n He's  even  got  the  sound,  bro. \n Oh  my  days.  Oh,  he's  going  to  get  it \n with  the  right  hand.  No.  KSI.  No.  Try \n again.  You  find  it. \n He's  calling  coach's  comments.

What  is  wrong \n with  just  move  on,  man?  Damn.  Time \n flies.  Oh  man.  You  see,  I  did  not  see \n this  happening.  I  can't  lie.  I  did  not \n see  this  happening.  It's  I  blame  the \n chat,  bro.  It's  always  the  chat  coming \n up  with  stupid  ass  ideas  being  like, \n \"Oh,  why  don't  you  do \n this?  Fine,  do  it.\"  This  is  the  year \n where  I  actually  make  [ __ ]  happen.  Okay, \n everyone  who's  watching,  I  want  you  to \n go  on  Reddit  and  post  videos  where  I \n said,  \"Oh,  I'm  going  to  do  this.\"  And  I \n never  did  it.  Okay?  No,  but  I'm  not \n going  to  do  porn  with  Celestia  Vega. \n Everything  except  this  video.  Okay?  I \n will  do  everything  except  this  video. \n Give  me  show  me  all  the  things  that  I \n said  I'll  do  but  I  didn't  manage  to  do \n except  for  this  one.  He's  done  the \n giveaway.  Look,  you're  happy  now.  It's \n done,  guys.  Look  at  that.  The  door \n giveaway  is  complete.  Now,  let's  move \n on.  Origins  of  JJ  Hate  for  the  door. \n What?  I  I  don't  hate  doors.  I  just  hate \n this  whole  door  giveaway  thing.  But, \n okay.  Anyway, \n what?  Why  is  the  door  locked?  Why  is \n this  door  locked?  I  want  to  die.  I  want \n to  die.  I  was  so  close.  So  close  to \n finding  someone.  And  a  [ __ ]  door \n decided  to  ruin  my  life.  Now  what?  Now \n what  do  I  do?  [ __ ]  play  on  my  dick  or \n something?  Like  what  the  hell, \n man?  If  KSO  was  a  lion,  bro  accepted  his \n fate. \n What  is  this  post?  What  is  going  on, \n man?  Ed  Sheeran  asking  KSI  for  a  pick \n before  GTA  6.  It's  so  funny  the  amount \n of  people  messaging  me  being  like,  \"Oh \n my  god,  I  can't  believe  Ed  Sheeran  asked \n for  you  and  Speed's  uh  picture.\"  And  I'm \n like,  \"Guys,  you  do  know  that  isn't  Ed. \n Do  you  think  Ed  Sheeran  would  ask  for  a \n picture  with  me  and  Speed  as  if  we've \n never  met  before?\"  I've  met  Ed  so  many \n times,  guys.  Just  stop.  But  fair  play  to \n this  guy.  Imagine  being  a  lookalike  and \n just  getting  plenty  of  [ __ ]  from  that. \n Let's  not  beat  around  the  bush.  It's \n true.  Am  I  Am  I  wrong?  Am  I  wrong?  He \n is.  I  bet  I  bet  he  smashed  plenty  of \n women  or  men,  whatever  he's  into  just \n because  he  looks  like  Ed  Sheeran.  people \n would  just  have  sex  with  them  because \n the  people  they  probably  think  it's  Ed \n Sheeran  or  if  they're  drunk  as  hell  and \n they  think  it's  Ed  then  [ __ ]  they're \n going  to  be  messaging  their  friends  the \n next  day  like  yo  I  shag  dead  cheering \n here's  the  picture  and \n then  and  then  I'm  sure  a  funny  story \n will  come  from  that  this  bro  is  finally \n doing  it  guys  can  you  understand  how \n [ __ ]  this  meme  is  just  not  funny  it's \n not  it's  not  enjoyable  it  there's \n literally  nothing  to  it  first  time \n watching  the  stream  and  this  is  what  I \n see.  I  mean,  this  might  have  been  a  bad \n time  to  look  at  the  stream,  but  sure. \n It's  lit  three.  Get  over \n there.  You're  going  to  die.  I'm  going  to \n be  over.  Get  your  hand  over \n there.  Okay.  Also,  why  was  he  moving  so \n zesty  with  these  ass  pumps?  Like,  why  is \n he  bending  over  like  this?  Like,  all  you \n got  to  do  is  just  arch  your  back  and  let \n me  spank  you  with  the  belt  because  we're \n playing  FIFA  with  a  belt.  Why  is  he \n buying  this  lip?  Why  is  he  buying  this \n lip?  What  the  [ __ ]  man?  Are  you  ready? \n Are  you  ready?  No.  I  didn't  realize  how \n zesty  this  boy  was.  Man,  I'm  going  to \n kill  you.  Make  sure  the  world  can  see. \n You  can \n [Music] \n see  I  [ __ ]  went  hard  as  hell,  bro.  I \n went  so  hard.  Guy  kept  [ __ ]  moving \n though.  But  bro,  I  went  nuts.  I  was \n like,  \"Yo,  I'm  about  to  I'm  about  to \n mark  you.\" \n That  [ __ ]  hurt.  I  went  nuts.  Imagine  you \n you  just  click  and  you  just  see  this. \n You're  there  like  what  the  [ __ ]  is  going \n on?  But  we  were  playing  with  about. \n Okay,  there  was  a  you  just  need  a  bit  of \n context  and  that's  why  you  got  to \n continue  watching  the  stream.  But  look \n anyway,  shut \n up.  Shut  the  [ __ ]  up,  man.  This  [ __ ] \n cat  always  screaming. \n What? \n I'm  going  through  a  hard  time.  I  just \n want  my  own  door.  A  real  chance.  I  want \n to  be  as  happy  as  the  guy  in  the  picture \n with  his  door.  No.  Honestly,  guys,  I \n might  start  banning  people.  Everyone's \n bored  now.  Stop.  Same \n energy.  But  you  know  what?  I'd  much \n rather  be  Shrek  than  the \n donkey.  Just  opened  the  stream,  bro. \n What  the  [ __ ]  is  that,  bro?  Honestly, \n even  I  was  just  beused.  I  don't  know \n what  was  going  on  at  this  point.  Oh,  we \n we  reached  the  weird  part  of  the \n internet.  The  weird  part  of  the  stream. \n Well,  JJ,  you  never  did  the  part  two. \n Okay,  let  me  see.  Put  ourselves  through \n hell  for  this  video.  So,  how  many  likes? \n Uh,  a  million. \n A  million.  A  million.  He  thinks  I'm  him. \n That's  because  I'm  bigger.  I  don't  think \n the  video  got  a  million.  So,  also  I \n don't  know  if  I  could  do  that \n video  because  oh  my \n god,  that  was  a \n very  so  awkward,  man.  When  KSA  got \n flashed  by  something.  Make  us  laugh,  you \n win \n money.  Oh  man,  bro,  people  do  some  weird \n [ __ ]  on  Amigle,  man. \n KSI's  least  watched  video  in  15  years. \n Scrolled  all  the  way  down  uh  in  the \n popular  section  on  this  channel.  No, \n this  is  peak  unemployment  right \n here.  I  mean,  fair  play.  I'm  actually \n lowkey  interested.  FIFA  11  top  five \n goals  of  the  week,  episode  7.  That's \n such  a  weird  one  to  be  like  my  lowest \n view. \n 36,000  views  on  a  video,  which  is  crazy \n because  like  I  can't  even  imagine  a \n video  getting  that  on  any  of  my \n channels.  Like  if  I  ever  got  this  many \n views  on  a  channel  of  mine  that  I  post \n regularly,  I  think  I'd  have  to  retire. \n At  that  point,  YouTube  has  left  me.  You \n know what  I  mean?  The  career  has  left \n me.  Leave  YouTube  before  YouTube  leaves \n you.  At  that  point,  YouTube  has  left \n you. \n Like,  imagine  I  had  all  these \n subscribers,  millions  of  subscribers, \n and  I  can't  even  crack  50K.  No,  man. \n It's \n done.  Putting  the  gloves  in  the  middle \n of  the  ring,  and  I'm  bowing  out, \n bro.  Nah,  let's  run  this  up,  man.  Let's \n at least  get  this  to  50K.  15  14,000  of \n you  to  type  this  video  out  in  the  search \n bar  and  click  it.  Let's  get  it  to  50K. \n And  we  got  FIFA  11  top  goals  this  week. \n And  today  we've  got  some  very  nice \n goals.  We  start  with  number  five.  Okay, \n we  have  driver  91.  I  wonder  why  they \n call  him  driver.  Is  it  because  he's \n going  to  drive  the  ball  from  40  yards \n into  the  back  of  the  net?  Oh \n yeah.  This  was  old  KSI  before  old  KSI. \n Holy  [ __ ]  I  lowkey  want  to  watch  the \n whole  of  this  video,  but  I'm  not  going \n to  bore  you  with  it.  Um,  we'll  leave  it \n there.  This  has  been  your  boy  KSI.  Thank \n you  guys  for  watching.  I'll  see  you  guys \n in a  bit.  Take  care.  Peace.",
