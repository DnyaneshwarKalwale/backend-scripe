  "transcript": "this  LinkedIn  infographic  made  thousands \n of  likes  and  hundred  of  thousands  of \n Impressions  and  it's  not  the  only \n infographic  I  did  I've  created  hundreds \n of  infographic  like  this  one  that \n generated  millions  of  views  on  LinkedIn \n which  helped  me  to  generate  leads  sales \n and  revenue  for  my  business  now  the \n question  is  you  see  so  many  infographic \n on  LinkedIn  some  of  them  they  don't \n perform  at  all  and  other  ones  like  this \n one  are  generating  millions  of  views  in \n this  video  I'm  going  to  explain  how  I \n created  this  infographic  with  a  detailed \n breakdown  of  the  post  so  you're  going  to \n understand  why  it  is  performing  better \n than  the  other  ones  on  LinkedIn  and \n you're  going  to  be  able  to  use  the \n principles  for  LinkedIn  infographics  but \n also  for  other  designs  that  you  might \n have  so  let's  jump  into  the  analysis \n right  now  as  you  can  see  here  this  is \n the  infographic  but  with  the  text  and \n with  my  profile  picture  and  this  is \n where  I'm  going  to  start  with  the  first \n point  of  this  analysis  you  see  here \n there  is  my  profile  picture  my  name  and \n also  the  value  proposition  of  my  profile \n so  it's  very  important  for  you  to  ask \n yourself  what  is  the  value  proposition \n of  your  profile  why  are  people  going  to \n follow  you  here  I  say  I  helped  B2B \n businesses  attract  buyers  with  content \n with  this  simple  tagline  people  know \n that  I'm  talking  about  B2B  business  that \n my  focus  is  on  content  content  marketing \n and  that  it  helps  them  to  add  track \n buyers  and  this  will  also  have  an  impact \n on  the  infographic  then  as  you  can  see \n in  the  hook  of  the  posts  I'm  saying  I've \n helped  over  400  businesses  with \n marketing  most  of  them  face  this \n situation  you  see  with  this  hook  I'm \n introducing  the  topic  with  a  bold \n headline  that  triggers  curiosity  so \n people  want  to  know  what  is  this \n situation  it's  also  straight  to  the \n point  and  specific  with  a  number  I  say \n that  I've  helped  400  businesses  and  also \n it  shows  that  I'm  going  to  talk  about  a \n problem  that  a  lot  of  businesses  are \n facing  so  here  what  happens  is  that  it \n triggers  curiosity  because  people  want \n to  know  more  and  then  you  have  the \n infographic  just  below  the  most \n important  part  of  the  post  so  the  first \n part  of  the  infographic  is  my  name  with \n my  picture  because  I  know  a  lot  of \n people  are  going  to  screenshot  it  save \n it  send  it  to  friends  or  to  colleagues \n or  to  clients  and  partners  so  I  include \n my  name  so  I  make  sure  that  in  any  case \n they  will  know  that  this  infographic \n comes  from  me  and  it's  also  very \n important  for  you  to  link  your  expertise \n with  your  face  and  with  your  name  so \n people  associate  your  name  with  the \n topic  with  the  expertise  very  important \n trick  the  next  part  of  the  infographic \n is  a  big  explicit  title  so  as  you  can \n see  here  it's  very  simple  and  short  and \n impactful  the  four  layers  of  marketing \n problems  so  here  if  I  explain  the  title \n the  first  thing  you  see  is  the  four \n layers  I  attract  the  eyes  with  a  number \n which  is  four  and  I  talk  about  layers  so \n so  layers  is  an  interesting  word  because \n it  implies  the  fact  that  there  are \n multiple  layers  and  that  you  have  to \n Deep  dive  to  discover  the  next  layer \n then  I  say  that  it's  the  four  layers  of \n marketing  problems  so  here  I  talk  about \n problems  and  it  makes  it  even  more \n specific  that  I'm  talking  about \n marketing  problems  and  not  just \n Marketing  in  general  the  next  part  is \n the  explanations  of  the  graph  and  right \n after  that  I  will  explain  how  I  created \n this  graph  you  see  here  I  add  a  small \n and  short  legend  that  describes  the \n infographic  even  more  the  first  one  is \n businesses  often  focus  on  layer  one  and \n then  but  layers  three  and  four  are  often \n the  problem  so  here  it  gives  a  bit  of \n context  and  it  explains  what  I  want  to \n say  inside  the  graph  and  I  also  explain \n this  inside  the  copy  of  the  post  as  you \n can  see  now  here  is  why  the  post  perform \n really  well  as  you  can  see  the  two \n arrows  they  Point  directly  to  the  graph \n and  here  I  structure  the  marketing \n problems  into  four  layers  the  first \n layer  here  is  sface  level  problems  then \n we  have  structural  problems  strategic \n problems  and  product  problems  so  here \n it's  a  way  to  structure  the  entire \n marketing  process  with  the  fourth  layer \n being  something  that  is  at  the  surface \n then  layer  number  two  is  about  systems \n Layer  Three  is  about  strategic  problems \n that  are  important  and  last  but  not \n least  layer  number  four  the  problem  so \n here  what  I'm  trying  to  say  is  that \n businesses  they  always  focus  on  the \n surface  level  because  it's  what  they  can \n see  for  example  it's  hard  to  generate \n leads  so  it  might  be  because  of  the \n copyrighting  or  because  of  the  tactics \n they  are  using  but  actually  the  truth  is \n that  it's  because  of  something  that  is \n deeper  a  bit  like  the  iceberg  concept \n it's  below  the  surface  so  that's  why  we \n don't  focus  on  it  but  this  is  where  the \n problem  really  lies  so  here  I  have  a \n concept  which  I  just  explained  you  can \n have  the  metaphor  of  the  iceberg  in  mind \n now  what  I'm  doing  is  that  I'm  just \n taking  a  square  with  round  shape  and  I'm \n creating  four  layers  and  I  just  rank  the \n different  aspects  into  each  layer  as  you \n can  see  the  first  one  is  product  some \n people  would  also  call  it  brand  then  the \n second  layer  is  positioning  offer \n messaging  ICP  then  budget  system \n consistency  and  then  copy  tools  content \n so  when  I  have  my  four  layers  like  this \n it's  structured  I  just  need  to  add  the \n keywords  in  order  to  make  it  very \n specific  and  then  you  have  the  last  part \n of  the  infographic  with  the  Legend  So  In \n The  Legend  I  just  explain  what  the \n layers  are  about  as  I  explained  so  here \n you  have  a  winning  infographic  why \n because  first  I'm  talking  about \n something  that  a  lot  of  marketers  and \n Founders  have  experienced  is  when  you \n have  a  problem  but  you  don't  know  where \n it  comes  from  so  people  really  relate  on \n this  second  it's  visually  pleasing  you \n see  the  colors  have  red  orange  yellow \n and  green  and  it  attracts  the  eyes \n because  the  graphic  execution  is  well \n done  and  third  there  is  the  title  plus \n the  Legends  and  also  the  copy  of  the \n text  that  adds  context  to  this \n infographic  so  it  makes  it  worth  reading \n and  I'm  retaining  the  attention  with \n this  so  I'm  attracting  the  attention \n with  the  design  which  is  beautiful  and \n then  I'm  retaining  it  with  the  concept \n with  the  copy  all  the  keywords  and  also \n the  legend  and  the  funny  thing  is  that \n I've  reused  this  infographic  in \n different  formats  so  I've  posted  it  four \n times  on  LinkedIn  every  time  I  get  good \n performance  I  also  used  it  for  a \n newsletter  for  an  ebook  and  inside  my \n course  as  well  by  the  way  if  you  are \n interested  to  create  great  B2B  content \n for  your  business  to  attract  by  you \n should  have  a  look  at  my  course  and  if \n you  are  not  ready  to  buy  the  course  yet \n you  can  have  a  look  at  this  free  five \n day  email  course  where  I  explain  the \n five  LinkedIn  formats  that  performs  the \n best  all  right  now  you  know  why  this \n infographic  made  millions  of  Impressions \n and  thousands  of  likes  if  you  like  this \n video  tell  me  in  the  comment  and  I  will \n do  another  infographic  breakdown \n remember  that  the  most  important  is  to \n start  from  a  very  interesting  insight \n and  topic  that  your  audience  is \n interested  about  then  have  a  strong \n title  a  graph  that  explains  and \n illustrates  your  point  and  then  it's  all \n about  the  graphic  execution  as  well  all \n right  thanks  for  watching  this  video  I \n will  see  you  in  the  next  one",
