  "transcript": "gone  How  are  you?  How  are  you?  Brother? \n Well,  do  you  see \n Madrid?  Go  see  Madrid  from  time  to  time.  Yes, \n because  my  son  Mateo  really  likes \n Mbappé  and  I  have  no  doubt  that  he's  going  to  bring \n a  lot  of  joy.  The  affections  of  Real \n Madrid.  You've  never  had  a  bad  relationship \n with  us,  never  had  the  other  way  around.  We've  shared \n the  awards  stage  for  15  years  and  we  always \n talk  very \n well.  How  do  you  manage  that?  What's  your \n routine  like  in  penalties?  The  one  from  Oblac  that \n OBL  stopped  from  you  in  the  Euros  is  something  that  you \n 've  felt  many  times?  What  did \n Vinicios  feel  here  that  night?  What's  the \n Cristiano  like  that  people  don't  see?",
