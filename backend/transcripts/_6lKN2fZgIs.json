  "transcript": "I've  spent  over \n 4,265  th000  hours  on  LinkedIn  and  I've \n tested  every  growth  hack  that  exists  but \n the  truth  is  99%  of  them  are  useless  so \n rather  than  wasting  thousands  of  hours \n testing  all  the  hacks  that  don't  work \n I'm  going  to  teach  you  the  seven  weird \n LinkedIn  hack  that  helped  me  hit \n 180,000  followers  the  1%  of  LinkedIn \n hacks  that  are  so  good  they  should  be \n illegal  so  if  you  want  to  blow  up  your \n business  in  the  next  12  months  become  an \n expert  in  your  field  and  have  famous \n entrepreneurs  start  following  you  I \n suggest  you  pay  attention  now  the  first \n hack  is  one  of  my  favorites  because  it \n can  literally  double  or  triple  your \n views  without  any  extra  effort  on  your \n side  12  months  ago  my  friends  and  I \n discovered  this  by  accident  and  this  is \n the  first  time  I'm  talking  about  it  life \n so  you  probably  never  heard  of  it  before \n it's  called  time  zone  hacking  and  this \n is  how  it  works  LinkedIn  sends  a \n notification  to  your  followers  every \n time  you  repost  a  post  and  what  I \n noticed  was  that  every  time  I  repost  6 \n hours  later  the  engagement  on  that  post \n would  increase  by  up  to  20%  so  basically \n if  I  was  posting  at  12:30  UK  time  which \n meant  that  the  majority  of  my  us \n audience  was  asleep  or  just  getting \n ready  for  work  I  would  then  repost  6 \n hours  later  which  gave  me  a  second \n chance  to  reach  them  and  gain  slightly \n more  engagement  and  a  couple  new \n followers  from  that  time  zone  and  every \n time  I  do  this  I  get  at  least  10  new \n comments  instantly  but  this  timeon  hack \n won't  work  if  you  use  it  on  a  bland \n piece  of  content  however  it  can  make  you \n viral  if  you  combine  it  with  a  truly \n unique  post  which  is  where  the  second \n hack  comes  in  because  there's  there's \n thousands  of  how-to  content  online  blog \n post  articles  and  even  Chach  PT  can \n write  that  but  there's  only  one  how  I \n piece  of  content  and  that  comes  from  you \n the  only  person  that  can  write  that  is \n the  person  that  lift  it  you  and  people \n follow  people  for  their  unique  insights \n not  for  something  that  can  be  found  with \n a  quick  Google  search  so  next  time  you \n write  a  post  use  your  personal \n experience  to  write  it  let  me  show  you \n how  you  can  turn  the  most  boring  typical \n piece  of  content  into  a  personal  and \n engaging  piece  using  this  exact  same  tip \n and  we're  going  to  use  my  slay  framework \n to  do  just  that  let  me  show  you  now  the \n slave  framework  is  broken  down  into  four \n key  elements  story  lesson  actionable \n piece  of  advice  and  a  u  I've  chosen  this \n pose  that  I  literally  just  found  on  my \n feet  to  edit  and  this  is  what  we  ended \n up  with  after  implementing  this \n framework  onto  it  we've  taken  it  from \n just  a  simple  announcement  to  an \n actually  outstanding  piece  of  content  it \n works  like  magic  I  promise  but  another \n way  to  stand  out  on  LinkedIn  is  to \n become  an  expert  in  a  specific  Niche  and \n the  th  hack  is  amazing  for  just  that  you \n see  the  number  one  mistake  that  LinkedIn \n creators  make  is  that  they  do  not  repeat \n themselves  enough  they  feel  that  they've \n already  said  it  or  even  worse  someone \n else  already  has  said  it  but  to  become  a \n true  Authority  in  your  Niche  you  need  to \n be  using  the  beta  main  Hub  frequency \n bias  here's  how  it  works  the  more  you \n post  about  one  thing  the  more  people \n will  associate  you  with  that  same  thing \n so  if  you  want  to  be  known  as  the  next \n productivity  gr  for  example  it  makes \n sense  that  80%  of  your  content  is \n productivity  based  and  to  consistently \n talk  about  it  every  single  day  same \n thing  goes  for  your  values  if  you  have  a \n specific  value  such  as  kindness  then \n honing  in  on  that  through  your  content \n supports  that  same  bias  it  reinforces \n your  Authority  on  those  topics  in  your \n audience's  mind  remember  repetition \n don't  write  doesn't  bore  people  it \n reinforces  if  you  really  want  to \n reinforce  your  Authority  and  become  a \n big  boss  in  that  specific  space  in  your \n Niche  then  you  can  make  use  of  hack \n number  four  and  when  I  realize  it's \n power  it  blew  my  mind  but  before  I \n revealed  this  key  step  I've  left  a  free \n 20  plus  page  resource  for  you  to \n download  in  the  description  it  includes \n the  seven  weird  tips  that  I'm  talking \n about  in  this  video  plus  a  few  extra  to \n build  grow  and  monetize  your  LinkedIn \n and  while  you're  down  there  please  like \n this  video  and  hit  the  Subscribe  button \n it  helps  the  channel  grow  it  makes  me \n feel  good  and  I  can  justify  spending \n over  4,000  hours  analyzing  LinkedIn \n content  for  absolutely  no  reason  now \n hack  number  four  blew  my  mind  because \n human  connection  is  everything  and  I \n think  we  all  learned  that  the  hard  way \n during  Co  and  that  is  always  going  to  be \n the  limit  ation  with  the  internet  and \n social  media  particularly  with  written \n content  the  lack  of  human  connection  but \n back  in  February  I  understood  how  to \n combine  the  power  of  social  media  with \n human  interactions  using  real  time  live \n streams  and  events  see  many  people  can \n fake  being  Pros  via  written  content  but \n live  no  chance  by  going  live  you  give \n your  audience  real  life  value  by \n answering  their  questions  and  explaining \n your  key  topic  of  expertise  but  you  also \n build  trust  because  when  you  go  live  you \n audience  gets  to  see  the  real  you \n unscripted  unedited  and  authentic  this \n is  so  hard  to  replicate  for  anyone  else \n that  isn't  you  and  it  can  be  a  gold  mine \n for  your  business  and  if  you're \n comfortable  putting  yourself  out  there \n in  the  aim  of  being  authentic  and  taking \n this  to  the  next  level  then  hack  number \n five  is  for  you  because  LinkedIn \n recently  released  collaborative  articles \n and  they  are  all  the  hype  right  now \n because  if  your  mini  article  gets  upbed \n then  you  win  a  nice  batch  of  Honor  that \n goes  straight  into  to  your  profile  it \n looks  good  it  makes  you  look  credible \n but  that's  not  the  hack  that  I'm  talking \n about  because  while  everyone  is  making \n an  effort  to  look  good  and  sound  like  an \n expert  we  might  as  well  do  the  opposite \n and  still  win  a  nice  little  badge  so  how \n do  we  do  that  well  you  can  gamify \n collaborative  articles  by  entertaining \n people  instead  these  articles  have  very \n serious  questions  and  if  you're  a  very \n serious  person  then  sure  give  your  best \n political  answer  but  if  you're  like  me \n in  proda  PN  interrupt  it  wakes  people  up \n you  get  them  to  stop  think  engage  smile \n it  works  like  a  charm  every  single  time \n just  like  this  post  or  this  one  you \n inevitably  smile  or  at  least  stop  your \n scroll  to  see  what's  going  on  one  thing \n I  learned  about  LinkedIn  is  that  people \n there  want  to  laugh  just  like  every \n other  platform  people  just  want  to  feel \n alive  and  like  people  it  is  a  social \n media  platform  after  all  so  do  just  that \n give  them  one  more  reason  to  laugh  that \n day  take  a  collaborative  article  and \n write  a  light-hearted  tip  or  story  that \n compliments  it  not  with  the  aim  to  get  a \n badge  but  with  the  aim  to  entertain \n those  who  are  watching  this  is  literally \n how  you  turn  lers  into  fans  again  your \n story  personality  and  even  the  way  you \n talk  is  everything  online  use  it \n wherever  you  can  because  no  one  isse  but \n what  happens  if  you're  posting  all  the \n content  right  and  playing  the  LinkedIn \n game  correctly  but  you  still  aren't \n getting  any  engagement  on  your  post  well \n you  might  need  hack  number  six  because \n you  could  be  Shadow  bands  so  here's  how \n you  get  out  of  this  Shadow  band  go  to \n your  most  recent  post  and  see  who's \n engaging  with  it  message  5  to  10  of \n those  people  thanking  them  for  their \n comment  and  maybe  do  some  Li  talk  and \n remind  them  to  hit  your  bell  if  they \n like  your  content  or  got  any  value  from \n it  this  reinforces  your  connection  as \n most  of  us  don't  really  talk  to  our \n followers  often  and  secondly  you  want  to \n do  this  with  new  people  who  are  active \n go  to  your  LinkedIn  feed  and  scroll  to \n see  who's  posting  and  if  you're  already \n connected  with  them  do  the  same  now \n every  time  you  connect  with  someone  new \n go  through  this  exact  same  process  this \n will  Fast  trck  you  out  of  getting  from \n your  potential  Shadow  band  this  isn't \n technically  a  hack  but  it  does  get \n traffic  back  to  your  profile  and  reminds \n people  that  you  exist  so  when  LinkedIn \n sees  that  more  people  are  visiting  your \n profile  it  will  show  it  to  more  people \n it's  literally  how  social  media  works \n and  finally  the  question  you  have  all \n been  waiting  for  how  can  you  get  your \n ideal  clients  celebrities  and  your \n favorite  influencers  to  connect  with  you \n and  comment  on  your  posts  well  I \n personally  use  the  sniper  method  you  can \n make  a  list  of  Ideal  clients  or  people \n you'd  love  to  be  seen  by  then  every  day \n you  go  to  their  profiles  and  comment  on \n their  content  on  time  so  if  they  post  at \n 12:00  you  need  to  be  on  their  profile  at \n 12  on  the  dot  so  you  can  be  one  of  the \n first  people  to  comment  now  here's  a \n trick  you  can't  just  come  up  with \n something  Bland  the  comment  needs  to  be \n insanely  valuable  because  those  comments \n start  a  sub  conversation  with  the  author \n of  the  post  as  well  as  With  Their \n audience  which  can't  get  you  hundreds  of \n new  likes  and  Views  just  like  that  and \n if  it  all  works  as  planned  you  can \n connect  with  your  ideal  client  straight \n away  and  if  not  you  connect  with  the \n audience  which  gets  you  more  visibility \n and  grows  your  audience  anyway  and  that \n then  increases  the  chances  of  your  ideal \n connection  seeing  you  because  their \n audience  are  all  connected  with  you \n which  then  builds  trust  with  your  ideal \n Target  and  this  is  exactly  what  happened \n to  me  I  did  this  for  months  and \n eventually  because  my  comments  and \n content  were  so  good  my  profile  grew \n which  led  to  more  people  engaging  with \n it  pushing  me  closer  to  these  people  in \n these  networks  increasing  my  chances  of \n my  post  appearing  on  their  daily  morning \n LinkedIn  scroll  and  then  I  connected \n with  them  remember  to  win  online  you \n need  to  make  yourself  valuable  and  the \n best  way  to  do  this  is  to  show  up  daily \n and  sincerely  try  to  help  your  audience \n because  that  way  you  cannot  fail  when \n your  intentions  are  pure  you  will  never \n lose  but  here's  a  catch  if  you're  trying \n to  build  your  business  and  generate \n leads  there's  one  thing  you  need  to  set \n up  up  correctly  otherwise  all  your  new \n leads  and  connections  will  be  for \n nothing  so  check  out  this  video  where  I \n show  you  how  to  turn  your  LinkedIn \n profile  into  a  lead  generation  machine \n see  you  there",
