 and  then  Jas \n and  NATO  yet  to  drop  a  set  on  the  other \n side  we  have  stupa  and  LeBron  also  yet \n to  drop  a  set  in  the  entire  tournament \n compano  Sanchez  Dino  Garo  and  then \n Cardona  oxburger  not  an  easy  road  to  the \n finals  at  all  for  stupa  and \n LeBron  they  actually  lost  a  set  in  the \n [Music] \n semi-finals  against  Cardon  oxburger  the \n team  that  beat  for  example  Chingo  Gand \n the  number  twos  and  probably  the  biggest \n Rivals \n Foria  LeBron  was  playing  at  the  end  of \n the  season  with  Martin  Dino  they  split \n and  now  they're  playing  together  with \n Franco  stupas  but  first  things  first  the \n number  one  the  King  aruro  coo  born  in  B \n 190  for  him  very  tall  player  as  a  lefty \n always  playing  on  the  right  side  of  the \n court  if  you're  new  to  the  sport  you \n have  to  know  that  if  you're  a  lefty  you \n always  play  on  the  right  side  of  the \n Court  born  in \n 2002  and  sharing  the  team  with  AIA  quo \n moving  now  to  Miami  so  big  question  mark \n around  guo  and  he's  level  big  decision \n from  aruro  guo  moving  from  Spain  where \n you  have  all  the  players  all  the  coaches \n and  you  train  really  hard  to  move  to \n Miami  to  invest  in  a  new  project  to  try \n to  make  it  grow  also  the  sport  in  in  the \n US  and  so  far  it's  working  first \n tournament  first  final  so  uh  nothing  to \n complain  about  playing  with  a  magic  man \n if  furo  quo  is  a  strong  and  very \n complete  player  this  guy  is  pure  magic \n pure \n talent  atin  Tapia  born  in  katar \n Argentina  179  for  him  playing  on  the \n left  hand  side  of  the  Court  the  backand \n player  big  smash  but  again  the  magic \n that's  the  most  beautiful  thing  about \n Tapia  an  absolute  Genius  of  the  sport \n for  many  players  and  for  many  fans  the \n best  in  the  world  I  would  put  also  in \n that  conversation  coo  and  also  Al  Galan \n Al  Galan  losing  earlier  in  the \n tournament  but  they've  been  dominant  so \n far  these  two  being  number  ones  almost \n for  two  years  ready  trying  to  go  now  for \n the  third  one  in  a  row  and  they  lost  one \n year  ago  here  in  the \n finals  trying  to  win  this  tournament  for \n the  first  time  the  r  season \n P1  time  for  us  to  go  to  the  other  side \n of \n theet  because  we  have  a  new  team  a  new \n combination  and  look  who's  there  Mr \n Christiano \n Ronaldo  one  of  the \n goats  he's  been  here  the  entire  week  he \n just  Lov \n tattle  game  for  the  D  Brothers  one  of \n the  two  best  Portuguese  players  and  he \n is  here  saying  yes  yes  I'm  going  to \n enjoy  the  finals  pretty  good  friend  to \n aruro  quo  for  example  they  did  a  nice \n video  on  social  media  last  year  and  the \n every  time  he  has  a  chance  he  goes  and \n play \n padle  the  opponents  franos  St  pasuk  also \n from \n Argentina  number  five  in  the  rankings \n he's  so  quick  he  is  really \n quick  flying  around  the  court  probably \n one  of  the  quickest  players  alongside \n Kino  very  physical  he  doesn't  have  a  lot \n of  power  compared  to  arur  quo  for \n example  or  or  Gan  but  he  has  a  super  rul \n he  goes  to  the  fence  always  with  this \n beautiful  overhead  brushing  the  ball \n creating  angles  and  again  flying  very \n fast  very  fast  the  transitions  from \n stupa  very  quick  and  now \n joining  the  wolf  very \n talented  Quan  Leon  the  wolf  you  will  see \n how  whenever  he  goes  for  a  smash  and \n gets  the  point  people  go \n oh  such  a  talented  player  and  again  he \n he  was  playing  always  on  the  right  side \n of  the  court  and  he  said  I  want  to  try \n something  new  I  want  a  new  challenge  and \n he  went  to  the  Batman  side  of  the  court \n to  play  with  Martin  Leno  it  didn't  work \n you  cannot  also  say  it  was  a  failure  but \n it  didn't  work  in  my  opinion  Leon  is \n better  when  he  plays  on  the  right  side \n of  the  court  and  now  he  decided  to  go \n back  there  go  back  home  let's  say  to \n play  with  Franco  stuk  and  so  quite  a \n good  combination  stupa  and  the  LeBron \n this  is  Charlie  pooni  Carlos  psoni  their \n coach  also  from \n Argentina  following  mainly  STA  and  they \n say  Gustavo \n PR  aruro  Coo's  coach  they  have  two \n coaches  coo  is  working  more \n with  and  Canal  working  with  Tapia  this \n is  Peter  CL  from  Belgium  hello  Peter \n have  a  good  one  and  we  will  go  to  the \n V  we  have  the  technology  also  available \n just  like  in  any  other  sport  players  can \n go  to  the  V  you  have  two  challenges  per \n set  if  you  win  the  challenge  you  keep  it \n if  you  lose  a  challenge  you  have  one  so \n on  and  so  forth  until  the  end  of  a \n set  camera  angles  of  this  cattle  Rush \n Arena  and  the  Beautiful  green  SE  it's \n very  typical  from  this  tournament  where \n we  at  season  P1  and  again  it's  been  a \n long  and  complicated  season  but  we're \n ready  to  have  a  big  final  with  a  big \n special \n guest  the  one  and  only  Cristiano  Ronaldo \n and  all  the  fans  here  as  well  thumbs  up \n time  to \n enjoy  Monday  finals  Monday  Monday \n finals  in  2024  the  conversation  was \n Chalan  kapia  who's  going  to  be  the \n number  one  at  the  end  of  was  Quon  Tapia \n the  one  dominating  but  it  was  basically \n a  two  teams  conversation  but  now  it's  a \n different  story  we  have  these  two \n joining  forces  playing  together  stupa \n and \n LeBron  and  getting  the  final  the  first \n tournament  is  going  to  mean  a  lot  of \n points  Leon  could  be  actually  the  only \n player  to  get  backto  back  championships \n here  backto  back  tournaments  he  won  a \n 2024  playing  with \n [Music] \n r  at  season  P  one  p  rusher  in  a  final \n stage  was  talking  now  to  Le  he  was \n say  I  need  you  to  be  smart  I  don't  want \n you  to  go  for  crazy  shots  sometimes  the \n adrenaline  you  know  it's  final  say  you \n want  to  go  for  more  you  want  to  prove \n yourself  and  you  go  for  risk  decisions \n risky  shots  not  the  day  to  do  it \n talking  about  the  the \n wind  in  which  direction  is  moving  today \n is  not  raining  which  is  fantastic  after \n a  long  and  Horn  weak  in \n Rat  talking  about  the  volle \n we  go  for  the  eight  the  eight  means \n eight  out  of  10  trying  to  be  consistent \n not  to  play  Bad  volleys  eight  out  of  10 \n every  single  time  have  the  chance  to  go \n for  a  nine  or  a  10  okay  perfect  but \n always  there  good \n level  time  to  enjoy  the  first  final  of \n the  Season \n Leonia  who  will  take  the \n trophy  we  you  have  the  green  light  fast \n in  your  seat  belts  grab  something  to \n drink  something  to  eat  play  sit  back  and \n enjoy  50 \n L  and  the  first  to  the  first  point  of \n the  tournament  the  first  point  of  the \n finals  goes  for  k \n flat  smash  from  Mia  down  the  line  back \n to  back  very  quick  30 \n love  that's  what  we  call  a  chaso  it's  a \n flat  smash  flipflop \n shot  and  now  again  from  uro  coo  this \n time  blocked  by \n stoa  short  smash  from  LeBron  4  and \n another  Chun  another  flip  flop  shot  from \n Tapia  make  it  to \n goes  aulo  it's  always  a  good  idea  to  go \n to  the  fence  you  never  know  what  bouns \n you're  going  to  get  a  winner  from  coo \n and  the  perfect  start  from  the  number \n ones \n kapia  and  hold  to \n love  if  you're  new  to  the  sport  you  will \n see  how  you  have  some  glasses  in  the \n back  and  then  some  part  of  the  court \n with  a  fence  the  ball  has  to  bounce \n first  on  the  court  and  then  it  goes  it \n can  go  to  the  back  or  to  the  side  walls \n or  to  the  fence  you  can  play  the  ball \n after  that  second  bounce  off  the  fence \n or  off  the  wall  so  that's  why  I'm  saying \n it's  always  a  good  idea  to  go  to  the \n fence  because  if  you  go  to  the  back  wall \n the  bounce  is  going  to  be  very  clean \n you're  going  to  be  able  to  read  it  if \n you  go  to  the  fence  it  can  bounce \n anywhere  take  your  seats  please  thank \n you  franos  stas  serving  for  the  team  for \n the  first  time \n good  volley  again  this  time  from  aruro \n coo  I  mean  he's  190  so  he  covers  a  lot \n of  space  just  a  matter  of  one  second \n he's  there  he  blocks  it  and  then  he \n placs  it  into  the \n corner  yet  to  score  points \n good  Wy  there  he  goes  Franco \n stas  watching  live  on  red  bu  TV  watching \n live  in  Premier  padle \n [Music] \n four  players  at  the  net  switching  sides \n STA  and  LeBron  and  the  Final  Smash  from \n uro  KO  you're  staying  short  which  is \n going  to  be  very  good  for  Franco \n stas  big  jump  and  the  dunk \n look  at \n that  super  smash  from  mapia  the  ball \n finds  the  back  and  jumps  Sky \n High  30 \n all  first  serving  game  for  stupa  Leon \n and  already  with  a  critical  point  this \n one \n from  the  back \n hand  more  than  good \n 40  that's  the  only  way  you  got  to  play \n to  Perfection  when  you're  facing  the \n number  ones  Leon  going  from  the  right \n side  to  the  back  hand  side  and  making  a \n jump  copy  paste  from \n AIA  4  30  a  chance  to  tie  things  up \n he  goes  again  the  block  from  AIA  this \n time \n [Music] \n up  scoring  same  as  in  tennis  so  now  we \n have  a \n duice  have  to  win  a  couple  points  in  a \n row  to  get  the \n game  Mr  Magic  Man  I  will  stop  you \n sta  joining  the  party \n now  down  the  line  he \n goes  perfect  smash  over  aturo  you  have \n to  make  a  jump  if  you  want  to  make  it \n you  want  to  take  it  back  to  your  place \n to  your  court  over  ATO  plus  the  Jump \n Plus  the  arm  and  the \n racket  lock  lcky \n break  lucky  break  for \n AIA  clipping  the  tape  and  they  will  have \n a  break \n point  those  are  the  ones  you  say  sorry \n but  deep  inside  you  you  know  you  really \n know  you  will  take \n them  it's  actually  a  ju  it  was  an \n advantage  for  sua  and  Leon \n this  time  Vette  says \n no  using  the  side  will  stupid  a  nice \n shot  and  now  Leon  doing  the \n same  easyy \n easyy  say  because  that  Back  Fence  it's \n four  meters  high  so  whenever  they  dunk \n it  like  that  it's  a  point  for  you  point \n is  over  and  you  call  it \n patro  hard  complicated  game  for  stupa \n and \n LeBron  and  they  will  have  a  break \n point  chasing  it  hunting  you  down  quo \n and  Tapia  too  high  from  stoa  allowing  a \n Tapia  to  jump  to  get  the  kicks  Smash  and \n to  bring  it \n back  the  L  was  perfect  from  AAP  but  the \n block  finds  the \n glass  could  wait  to  S  to  save  the  first \n break  point  of  the  match  juice  number \n four  first  game  for  guon  Tapia  was  a \n hold  with  love  not  losing  a  single  point \n And  now  when  stupa  and  Leon  serving  it's \n getting  complicated \n [Music] \n right  from  the  line  LeBron \n Pia  makes  it  in  and  sta  with  the  m  the \n court  to  finish  the \n point  we  had  to  wait  until  the  end  to \n see  if  that  Tapia  Scotch  was  going  in  or \n not  good  Port  down  the  line  from  the \n wolf  nice  save  from  Tapia  but  at  the  end \n of  the  day  if  you're  one  V2  you're  going \n to  be  unprotected  just  like  it  happened \n now  to  aruro \n can  they  close  it \n down  no  they  can't  use \n nice  ball  to  the  fence  again  from  Tapia \n smart  enough  sometimes  it's  better  just \n to  let  the  ball  fly  to  the  back  and  then \n wait  for  the  bounce  to  have  an  easier \n ball  and  is  a  shot  to  go  this  time \n Crossing  creating  the  angle  going  to  the \n fence  and  getting  another  break  point \n for  the  team \n I \n don't  they  will  go  to  the  V  STA  and \n LeBron  saying  that  the  ball  was  in  the \n Empire  is  saying  it  was  out  first \n challenge  of  the \n match  um  that's  close  I  think  it  was  in \n I  think  it  was  in  honestly  if  stupa  and \n Leon  right  they  will  keep  the  the  two \n challenges  if  they  lose  it  they  will \n have  only  one  until  the  end  of  the  set \n let's  see  what  the  VOR \n says  V  is  something  new  to  the \n sport  third  year  that  we  have  it  but \n very  new  overall  so  it  was  in  we  were \n right  both  St  Leon  and  I  I'm  going  to \n take  that  win  according  to  the  video  the \n BS  in  first  serve  so  we  will  have  a \n first  serve  and  ston  will  keep  the \n second  the  two \n challenges  still  a  break  point  though \n for  qu  Tapia \n aruro  coo  jumping  and  dunking  it  for  the \n break  look  at  that  reaction  from  the \n King  they  W  it  so \n bad  winning \n [Music] \n mentality  winning  so  many  tournaments  in \n 2024  losing  the  finals  to  kinet  and  John \n S  but  here  they  come  again  first \n tournament  and  they  won  it  so  bad \n Tapia  is  on  fire  today  Tapia  is  doing \n Tapia  things  and  that's  never \n good  no  block  from \n stoa  I  think  that  probably  LeBron  was \n going  to  get  that \n one  I  guess  we  will  never  know  but  out \n looking  everything  konia \n coach  30  love  couple  points  away  from \n the  perfect  start  from  the  number \n ones  last  finder  from  sta  it's  so  hard \n they're  closing  head  so  hard  so  good \n they  cover  every  single  space  and  if  you \n play  the  L  you  know  there's  the  threat \n of  the  smash  so  it  has  to  be  very \n precise  you  have  to  be  going  for  the \n very  last  edge  of  the  court  and \n sometimes  you  will  get  the  mistake \n soft  touch  too \n soft  playing  with  a \n scoreboard  40  love  going  for  the \n Highlight \n show  that's  going  to  be  really  short  and \n as  mentioned  as  soon  as  you  get  the  ball \n short  the  king  will  punish  you  three \n zero  start  for  coo  Tapia  enjoying  the \n first  set  of  the  finals  of  this  RI \n season  P1 \n spe  foree \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n concentration  concentration  to  be \n focused  to  stay  on  the  game  and  also \n talking  about  the  win  how  now  when  will \n play  some  LS  the  will  stop  because  they \n have  the  win  in  the  opposite  direction \n and  it's  going  to  be  very  tempting  for \n St  and  LeBron  to  go  for  the  smash  so \n they  were  talking  about  being  focused \n being  you  know  there  to  push  to  the  net \n in  order  to  climb  and  to  dunk  it  with  a \n recovery \n like  this  very  tempting  for  Leon  just \n like  plant  just  like  plant  tempting \n short  Lop  LeBron  goes  for  the  smash  and \n uro  quick  enough  to  go  there  to  the  net \n to  cross  the  court  run  and  then  easy  m \n long  the  ball  is  flying  the  wind  is \n pushing  toward \n air  305  this  could  be  a  good  chance  for \n sta  LeBron  to  get  at  least  one  game  on \n the \n board  what  a  ruler \n again  30 \n all  so  high  I  mean  look  at  how  he  goes \n up  there  takes  it  plays  it  to  Perfection \n to  the  fence  now  good  serve  from  Juan \n Leon  on  the  shotting  paddle  the  serve \n you're  not  going  to  win  a  lot  of  points \n like  in  tennis  but  Point  moments  a  good \n serve  he  give  you  some \n answers  and  they  have  the \n game  Tapia  lead  three  games  to  3-1  for \n Quon \n Tapia  that  could  be  a  conf  booster  for \n these \n two  build  some  momentum  stupa  and \n Leon  Charlie  bson  their  coach  watching \n absolutely \n everything  going  to  stupa  trapping  him \n in  the  corner  stupa  was  there  trying  to \n do  whatever  he  could  to  get  the  ball \n away  but  Goyo  was  going  there  and \n they're  punching  him  one  two  three  times \n just  to  get  the  point \n 30  love  when  tapion  are  serving  they're \n very  dominant  it's  really  hard  to  get \n points  from \n them  and  now  the  good  service  from  the \n King  uro  goo  40  love  another  clean  game \n for  kapia \n slicing  it  into  the  net  franos  yet  to \n get  his  a  game  today  for  one  coo  Tapia \n the  number  one  leing  getting  closer  to \n the  first \n set \n [Music] \n for  for \n [Music] \n gona  o  joining  you  in  the  broadcast \n commentating  this  epic  R  season  P1  final \n 41  coo \n Tapia  look  at  wind  it  is  you  can  see \n that  fan  having  some  misses  With  the \n Wind  serving  against  ston \n so  quick  Tapia  so  so  quick \n Tapia  dodging  that  smash  from  stupa  and \n then  going  back  to  the  net  and  boom  out \n of  the  Court \n bye-bye  what  a  save  again  from  Topia \n trapped  in  the  corner  but  he  resist \n everything  and  the  Final  Touch  from \n LeBron  trying  to  go  for  the  fancy  finish \n stays \n short  that  difference  from  to  you  cannot \n imagine  how  hard  it  is  to  be  there  close \n to  the  fence \n unprotected  that's  going  to  jump  that's \n going  to  be  more  than  good  from  stoa  but \n coming  back  to  that  short  drop  shot  from \n Leon  the  previous  Point  remember  the \n conversation  between  him  and  poon  at  the \n beginning  of  the  match  the  coach  was \n asking  not  to  go  for  anything  crazy \n especially  in  a  final  whenever  you're \n playing  gu  on  Tapia  you  got  to  go  for \n the  safe  play  not  for  the  risky  and \n beautiful \n shot  pushing  it  too \n much  that  slicing  forand  L  from  Juan \n LeBron  was  a  thing  of  a  beauty  pure \n [Music] \n class \n 40 \n 4030  fighting  for  every  single  point  on \n in \n sta  not  the  easiest  match \n today  this  is  something  that  we've  seen \n a  lot  in  uro  quo  recently  especially  and \n of  the  second  half  of  the  season  in  2024 \n how  he's  improving  from  the  back  he  has \n always  been  very  powerful  and  very \n dominant  from  the  back \n line  but  now  it's  a  different  monster \n it's  a  different  monster  from  the  back \n line  defending  playing  quality  lobs \n resisting  that's  why  probably  he's  the \n most  improved  player \n quo  the  jump  doesn't  leave  the \n court  and  that's  going  to  give  LeBron \n another  chance  to  finish  the \n point  42  Leon  St  I  thought  goo  was  going \n to  Dun  that  one  he's  doing  it  nine  out \n of  10 \n times  couldn't  take  it  and  that's  a  game \n for  the  number \n threes  in  that  race  for  the  number  one \n we  will  also  have  a  race  for  the  number \n two  stupa  and  LeBron  making  it  to  the \n finals  now  getting  more  points  and \n Chalan  losing  the \n quarters  I  don't  believe \n you  Tapia  flying  for  the  smash  but \n living  it  short  for  LeBron \n [Applause] \n there  you  go  the \n wolf  Tapia  was  ready  too  high  that  Banda \n from  LeBron  was  the  one  that  you  play \n just  to  send  the  problem  to  the  other \n side  of  the  net  but  Tapia  was  more  than \n ready  cutting  the  court  reading  the  play \n and  stupa  was  uh  like  a  keeper  facing \n three  Strikers  and  no \n Defenders  pure  power \n mamao  that  was  a  rocket  coming  to \n LeBron  and  it's  too  long  again  from \n LeBron  nothing  happening  for  Leon  and \n sta  when  receiving  and  another  hold  for \n kapia  and  just  like  that  the  number  ones \n are  only  four  points  away  from \n [Music] \n sec \n [Music] \n [Music] \n foree  for \n [Music] \n shot  that  you  execute  to  put  some  extra \n power  very  similar  technique  to  a  Banda \n with  using  a  bit  more  speed  and  power \n going  to  the  back  end  of  Arturo  Koo  so \n go  to  that  corner  it's  very  hard  to  do \n because  actually  coo  pushes  to  the  net \n you  will  never  stay  back  and  find  him  in \n the  corner  but  whenever  you  have  the \n chance  LeBron  says  Charlie  Pon  go  for \n that \n shotur  back \n [Applause] \n hand  50  stupa  and \n LeBron  playing  a  moss  Wing  game  if  they \n lose  it  we  will  have  the  first  set  for \n Kia  good  bounce  off  the  fence  from \n LeBron  Tapia  was  waiting  for  the  ball \n but  it  didn't  drop  in  a  good  way  for  the \n Argentinian \n [Applause] \n 4 \n love  what  a  smash  now  40  love  a  quick \n game  for  sta  Leon  and  they  needed  it \n important  for  them  to  stay  alive  in  the \n set  and  they  will  have  it  53  #  not  with \n my  serve  you  want  to  win  the  set  okay \n you  do  it  but  that's  going  to  be  with \n your \n serve  closing  the  doors  to  Pon  but  now \n quo  and  Tapia  serving  for  the \n set  three  points  now  three  points  away \n the  Chas  the  flipflop  shot  from  Austin \n Tapia  15 \n love  what  a  speed \n spinning  slicing  B  through  St  LeBron \n Tapia  back  to  back  winners  30 \n love  the  number  ones  are \n pushing  between  the  legs  goes  LeBron  but \n it  flies  just  in  good  shot  from  the  wolf \n what  a  save  from  aruro  coo  but  nothing \n you  can  do  with  that  shot  from  LeBron  to \n the \n corner  pure  CLA  this  point  from  LeBron \n between  the  legs  and  then  the  Finish  to \n the  corner \n on  the  line  H \n volley  Tapia  doing  Tapia  things  the \n magic  man  is  year  405  in

\n Lebron  in  the  beginning  of  the  second \n set  M  hit  from  LeBron \n for  that  smash  from  LeBron  was  so  bad \n that  it  became \n good  he  touched  the  ball  so  bad  that \n didn't  gave  aruro \n nor  goo  the  the  chance  to  go  to  the  n \n and \n dunit  point  for  St  a  chance  to  get  the \n first  game  of  the  second  set \n and  they  do  it  first  three  mistakes  from \n quo  in  one \n game  but  he  will  be  back  he  always  is \n back  R  season  P1  what  a  tournament \n complicated  week  with  a  lot  of \n rain  unfortunate  but  the  premium  P  team \n putting  an  enormous  effort  every  single \n depoint  in  order  to  have  a  really  nice \n final  like  the  one  we're  having  now  that \n quo  the  number  one's  making  it  again  to \n the  finals  in  RI  just  like  in \n 2024  Leon  also  was  part  of  that  finals \n back  then  playing  with  Ali  Galan  now \n sharing  the  court  with  a  Argentina  and \n the  new  porner  Franco \n stas  and  speaking  of  Franco  stas  showing \n some  moves \n Franco  stas  known  as  the  king  of  the \n Middle  East  the  king  of  the  Middle  East \n he \n won  in  Qatar  in  the  major  playing  with \n Martin  Dino  in  2023  he  won  in  Egypt  last \n season  in  the  P2  playing  with  Mike  young \n West  can  he  do  it  again  here  can  he \n conquer  another  country \n what  a \n smash  Sky  High \n and  now  the  one  smashing  it  hard  is  Juan \n LeBron \n 30  30  all  this  could  be  the  moment  for \n stupa  and \n LeBron  on  going  to  the  net  now  stba  has \n to  go  to  the  right  side  of  the  cour \n switching  sides  to \n [Applause] \n Pon  unfortunate  unfortunate  they  were \n fighting  for  the  first  break  point  of \n the  match  stup  and \n LeBron  went  for  the  angle  stupa  found \n the \n net  and  you  could  hear  the  vamos  from \n konia  showing  how  important  that  point \n was  hey \n [Music] \n [Music] \n use  last \n fighter  a  game  of  inches  this  one  the \n difference  between  being  perfect  and \n being  long \n couple  inches  but  they're  closer  getting \n closer  than  in  the  first  set  St  and \n [Applause] \n Leon  one  and  the \n fans  at  this  point  rooting  for  St  and \n LeBron  you  can  also  always  see  how \n people  get  involved  with  the  under  dos \n in  this  case  St \n Leon  after  this  game  we  go  through  the \n calendar  that  per  has  for  us  going  to  a \n lot  of \n countries  look  at  that \n P  look  at  that \n P  can  you  stop  dapia  can  you  just  stop \n going  back  from  behind  the  line  and  the \n ball  going  to  Qatar  from  R  to  Qatar  mama \n that  was \n mental  going  for  the  tiita  that's  a  shot \n that  we  use  in  paddle  in  order  to  go  to \n the  that  you  can  use  a  lot  to  go  over \n your  opponents  but  also  the  chikita  the \n ball  drops  there  the  opponent  has  the \n ball  be  low  than  it  the  only  option  you \n have  is  to  play  it  high  and  as  soon  as \n you  play  it  high  they  will  P  to  the  net \n they  will  be  waiting  for  you  and  they \n will  get  a \n point  classy  very  classy  instead  of \n going  for  quatro  because  probably  the \n ball  was  not  so  close  to  the  net  aruro \n spins  around  plays  with  the  back  end \n goes  to  the  fence  and  gets  a  bounce \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n from \n franos  the  Off  the  Wall  smash \n AKA  hey \n that's  the  chikita  we  were  talking  about \n how  they  push  to  the  net  now  they  win \n the  attacking  position  they  open  up  the \n door  good  ball  good  Gano  to  the \n fence  smart  really  smart  St  and  Leon  to \n close  every  single \n door  moving  KO  and  Tapia  at  the  net \n massive \n next  first \n between  and  Tapia  goes  the  wolf  one \n [Music] \n Leon  two  games  there  was  a  lot  of  things \n since  a  big  gap  between  Koo  and  Tapia \n Tapia  went  to  the  fense  to  block  that \n ruler  from  stupa  on  the  other  hand  you \n had  quo  way \n far  it's  a  game  two1  ST  LeBron \n second  foree \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n weia  the  season  opener  this  is  a  P1 \n tournament  then  we  will  go  to  Kon  and  to \n canun  for  a  couple  p2's  tournament  the \n p1's  tournament  give  more  Point  more \n ranking  points  and  the  p2s  then  Miami \n Santiago  Qatar  Brussels  Spain  Asun \n buenos  Italy  bad  R  Malaga  Scandinavia \n Madrid  Paris  Germany  roddam  Milano  new \n Giza  Dubai  Mexico  and \n Barcelona  24  tournaments  in  this  one  and \n only  2025  season  in  premium  paddle  and \n this  is  only  the  first \n stop  flat  smash  it's  paying  off  a  lot \n it's  been  the  fourth  time  that  we  see \n aop  using  this  kind  of  flat  Smash  down \n the  line \n too  much  trying  to  get  the  win  and  the \n winner  of  the  return  it \n on  got  to  be  better  than \n that  to  the \n next  those  are  the  ones  that  you  just \n basically  cannot  afford  when  you're \n playing  the  number  ones  and  then  serving \n and  you  lost  the  first  set  you  got  to  at \n least  play  the  point \n not  make  too  many  unforced  errors \n obviously  here  to  say  from \n here  back  to  back  smashes  from  Papito \n little  paper  franos  stas  his  nickname  in \n Spanish  papelito  because  he  flies  on \n court  he's  very  quick \n classy  very  classy  as  cheeky  as  you  can \n be  on  the \n Finish  that's  ice  cold  from  Juan  Leon \n [Applause] \n missing  it  missing  it  stuper  he  wanted \n to  play  the  ball  to  the  net  putting  it \n to \n sleep  finding  the  wrong  post  coat  here \n look  at  that  the  jump  and  he  tried  to \n play  the  ball  to  bounce  and  then  to  go \n to  the  net  Tapia  was  going  out  already \n to  catch  the  ball  through  the  door  it \n didn't  happen \n 405  no  PES  fromo  the  point  stays \n in  last  fighter  from  coo  good  call  from \n Tupa  Leon  was  about  to  hit  the  ball  and \n then  the  call  from  his \n team  right  decision  another  game  for  the \n number  three  is \n COO  and  Tapia  not  in  the  best  moment \n down  in  the  second  set  but  still  set \n up \n [Music] \n foree  foree \n we  didn't  have  any  single  break  point  so \n far  in  the  second \n set  upia  from \n downia  from  downtown \n and  now  sta  more  than \n ready  they're  B  they  are  here  to \n play  quick  hand  from  sta  to  save  the \n first  one  and  then  to  be  close  to  the \n net  after  this  match  from \n coo  getting  also  some  energy  from  the \n crow  feels  like  here  the  paddle  Rush \n Arena  and  defense  from  rette  some  more \n paddle  they  went  the  third \n set  sleep  back  yeah  it's  sleepy  Franco  I \n know  not  getting  a  clean  bounce  off  the \n back  W  there  sta \n unlucky  LeBron  going  for  the  smash \n sending  it  for  th  and  getting  another \n Point  much  better  much  much \n better  that's  LeBron  we \n know  can  they  do \n it  they  have  a  break \n point  oh  what  a  fake  what  a  fake  say \n you're  right  that  was \n Madness  look  good  that \n Madness  so  smart  everyone  was  expecting \n a  hard \n shot  now  the  chikita  placing  the  angle \n out  showing  all  the \n repertoire  number  one  for  a \n reason  hard  moments  your  opponent's \n pushing  you're  facing  a  30  all  situation \n and  then  you  go  for  a  beautiful  fake \n shot  down  the  line  and  then  the  angle \n I  mean  when  you're  good  you're \n good  that  was  close  but  it  was  out \n no  was  saying  LeBron  don't  go  through \n the  door  Franco  please  stay  stay  stay \n but  stupa  was  convinced  he  went  out \n Bronco  0 \n [Applause] \n 305  they  got  to  play  well  now  St  and \n Leon  usually  qu  and  tap  are  good  to  get \n the  breaks  in  the  right \n moments  you  feel  like  you  have  a  chance \n you're  there  close  close  close  but  at \n the  end  they  save  the  situation  and  they \n punch  you  where  you  going  out  but \n nothing  you  can  do  good  PES  this  time \n going  down  the  line  LeBron  40  we  saw \n another  pess  in  the  previous  game  going \n to  the  other  side  crosscourt  this  time \n going  to  the  other  direction \n he  went  for  the  magical \n touch  they  didn't  get  it  game  again  for \n St  lion  43  we're  approaching  now  the \n final  stretch  of  the  second  set \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n spe \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n a  much  better  second  set  from  St \n but  even  if  feel  they're  better  now  even \n if  stupa  and  Leon  are  finding  something \n strategically  so  far  they  didn't  have  a \n single  break  point  so  they  need  to  do \n even  better  in  order  to  have  a  chance \n against  the  number  one  s  on \n Tapia  and  again  I'm  telling  you  whenever \n the  number \n ones  know  there's  an  important  moment  of \n the  match  they  have  something  extra  and \n I'm  waiting  for  for  that  something  extra \n to  come  at  some  point  in  the  second \n set  that \n hurts  ouch  a  little  present  a  little \n souvenir  from  Riyad \n what  a  block  from  quo  what  a  block  quick \n hands  using  the  racket  as  a  shield  but \n not  only  blocking  the  bat  but  also \n placing  it  between  Leon  and \n sta  yeah  goes  for  that  one  but  is  not \n going  to  be  able  to  get \n it  4 \n 15  PES  from  quo  LeBron  missing  the  door \n game  for  tap  again  from  the \n King  four  games  a  piece  and \n now  the  this  game  the  next  game  my \n goodness  how  important  it \n is  pressure  on  for  ston \n what  an  angle  but  too \n short  feels  like  the \n [Music] \n moment  super  blocks  from  Tapia  and  the \n Finish \n AIA  shining  now  the  mozer  playing  some \n music  couple  blocks  and  then  the  finish \n I'm  telling  you  whenever  you  got  a  big \n good  day  you're  the \n best  oh  good  ball  good  Vol  slicing  it  to \n the \n point  point  that  one  with  st \n LeBron \n catching  on  the  way  good  ball  from  Juan \n LeBron  probably  the  forand  from  tapio \n was  too  high  getting  LeBron  the  chance \n to  push  to  get  closer  to  the  net  and  to \n attack \n LeBron  LeBron  to  the  net  3040  the  number \n one  s  Tapia  with  a  break  point \n where  you're  pushing  to  the  net  toia \n stay  back  LeBron  going  for \n theur  doesn't  take  it  what  a  way  to  save \n a  break \n point  he  was  close  he  was  really  close \n can't  imagine  a  lot  of  stup  and  LeBron \n fans  now  being \n like  that  was \n close  pushing  it \n [Applause] \n wide  doesn't  understand  how \n Tapia  in  the  semi  stupa  and  LeBron  had \n to  face  two  match  points  Cardon  and \n oxburger  with  a  couple  of  chances  to  be \n in  the  finals  they  didn't  do \n it  surviving  always  T  and \n LeBron  nice  fake \n smash  Juanito  LeBron  what  a  moment  to  do \n it  Juan  LeBron  squeeing \n it  love  the  of  the  Court  saving  a  set \n point  and  fighting  in  the  finals  Tupa \n and  Leon \n [Music] \n fore \n [Music] \n spee  foree \n [Music] \n [Music] \n let's  go  for  the  first  point  of  this \n game  and  now  the  number  once  with  a  back \n against  the  wall  in  the  second  set \n serving  to  stay \n [Applause] \n alive  they  had  it  they  just  had \n it  I  mean  if  you're  going  to  lose  a \n point  it's  better  to  do  it  this  way \n forcing  K  to  do  a  nice  defense  a  nice \n pick  up  and  then  going  for  the  smash \n stayed  short  but  at  the  end  of  the  day \n you  got  to  go  for \n it  effortless  fromo  and  LeBron  is  ready \n LeBron  is  ready  LeBron  is  having \n fun  yes  sir  5 \n brushing  the  ball  for  this  over  the \n fence  and  look  at  that \n save  face  bumping \n it  feels  like  it's  far  away  but  it's \n only  three \n [Applause] \n points  whenever  he  catches  the  ball  he \n CPS  the  ball  in  The  Sweet \n Spot  daia  just  destroys  the  ball  it's \n impressive  how  much  the  ball  jumps  and \n go  to  the  sky  in \n Riad  he  went  for  the  flat \n smash  he  found  the  net \n 30  this  could  be  a  good  moment  for  Tapia \n Ando  for  St \n Leon  and  second  serve \n from  the  line  goes  toia  living  it \n short  the  chump  from  Juan  LeBron  3040 \n the  first  break  point  of  the  match  was \n stoa  and  Leon  coming  in  the  ideal  moment \n set  point  stoa \n LeBron  thank  you  and  they  do  it \n to  send  it  to  a  third  and  final  set  here \n com \n St  the  final  push  finding  the  net  that \n hurts  that  hurts  Leon  in \n sta  now  you  got  to  go  again \n [Music] \n probably  a  little  bit  unthinking  the \n previous  Point  missing  the  return  a \n chance  for  five  games  a  piece  they  had  a \n set  points  to \n byon  and  now  they  survive  the  number  one \n showing  why  they  are  the  number \n ones  and  we  keep  rolling  in  the  second \n set \n good  dunk  again  now  from  Franco \n stas  they're  going  for  the  smashes  some \n sometimes  and  uh  it's  not  paying  off \n unless  you  get  a  good  L  and  you  can \n really  go  for  it  it's  not  worth  it  going \n for  the  smash  because  just  waiting  for \n you  closer  than  it \n fishing  also  when  you're  playing  a  final \n the  ADR  makes  you  go  for  it  you  want  to \n go  you  want  to  finish  the  point  as  soon \n as  you \n can  how  to  take  the  right  decisions  it's \n not  the  same  playing  now  than  doing  it \n in  the  first \n rounds  here  again  but  this  time  it's \n money  in  the  bank  for  from  franos  stas \n 305  great  B  great  ball  from \n Tapia  he  was  ready  blocking  and  then \n when  LeBron  went  to  the  middle  to  play \n that  back  can  it  was  too  easy  for  Tapia \n the  down  line  shot  was  unprotected  and \n the  free  empty  Corner \n 4  fans  are  going  wild  they  say  one  more \n one  more  one  more  point  to  secure  the \n tie \n Breck  he's  pting  so  much \n power  all  day  long  during  the  T \n LeBron  and  we  will  have \n [Music] \n [Music] \n new  for \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n LeBron  and  stupa \n legs  on  fire  we  need \n energy  we  need  some  energy  in  this  game \n they  had  a  set \n point  and  now  at  least  they  will  play  a \n tiebreaker  in  the  second  set  let's  see \n what  the  number  ones  have  to \n say  lucky  break  for  stupa  leaping  the \n net  making  it  awkward  for \n they  are  again  within  three \n points  perfectly  placed  into  the  cor \n what  a  love  that's  what  we  got  a  perfect \n love  I  mean  look  at  that  bouncing  in  the \n edge  of  the  Union  between  the  side  wall \n and  the  back  wall  there's  absolutely  no \n place  to  play  to  place  the  racket \n between  the  glass  and  the  ball  love \n [Applause] \n 30  it's  unfair  it's  unfair \n you  think  okay  I'm  at  the  net  that  was  a \n good  love  over  Topia  and  then  he  does \n that  a  three  point  again  from \n sta  ones  you  have  to  stop \n doing  I'm  just  still  thinking  on  that \n and  off  the  world  smash  with  the  back  in \n from  T  he  goes  for  the  line  he  goes  from \n the  line  he  goes  to  the  back  for \n 3040  and  yes  we  will  have  a  second  set \n point  for \n ston  thank \n youo  lives  it  short  and  the  on \n delers  slapping  it  P  out  of  the  Court  75 \n for  two  the  final  more  than \n [Applause] \n alive  a  third  and  final \n [Music] \n set \n [Music] \n for \n [Music] \n spee \n foree  fore \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n final \n set  one  break  for  St  11  on \n 75  getting  more  winners  and  uh \n 12  but  again  it's  a  match  where  you  have \n to  be  very  precise  in  the  key  moments \n and  it  feels  like  ston  found  something \n they  were  talking  about  the  lob  over  goo \n frustrating  the  Lefty  it's  working  it's \n really \n working  little  short  little  short  15 \n first  set  for  coo  Tapia  the  second  one \n for  stupa \n LeBron  only  one  set  to  play  and  one \n Championship  to  be \n claimed  5 \n back  to  back  short \n smashes  1530  1530  Quia  putting  some \n pressure  just  the  beginning  of  the  third \n set  no  need  to  go  for  those \n shots  patience  was  working  it  was  paying \n off  couple  times  they  went  for  a \n powerful  hit  and  it's  not  working  you \n have  to  also  take  into  account  that  at \n the  beginning  of  the  finals \n we  had  some  sun  it  was  during  the  day  so \n the  boat  was  flying  FAS  it  was  warmer \n now  it's  getting  late  it's  getting  cold \n humid  the  ball's  not  going  to  jump  as \n much  and  now  another  Point  Foria  1540 \n they  have  a  break  point  just  to \n start  this  could  be  hard  for  ston  you \n make  such  a  strong  effort  to  send  the \n match  to  a  third  set  and  you  give  away \n your  sered \n [Applause] \n no  oh  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa \n whoa  whoa  whoa  the  point  of  the  dman \n from  abin \n taia  the  point  of  the  tournament  from \n ainia  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no \n no  no  no  no \n no  what  was \n that  it  was  an  easy  DK  for \n LeBron  and  the  DK  the  point  of  the \n tournament  probably  of  the \n Season  yes  sir  and  he  knows  and  he  knows \n [Music] \n it  get \n know  50  l \n had  could  have  been  too  much  I  was \n trying  to  recover  from  that  point  I  mean \n I  just  stand  up  believe  with  Tapia \n did  now  we  30 \n love  side  booster  from  Leon  quick  hands \n from  uro  to  block \n it  and  you're  a  Saudi  fan  waited  the \n entire  week  to  watch  this  game \n I  mean  with  that  shot  from  Topia  you \n already  have  your  tet \n covered  and  coo  finishing  the  job  in  a \n big  way  feels  like  that  points  fromia \n gave  them  some  extra  energy  extra \n something  now  they're  having \n fun  moving  the  ball  creating \n angles  activating  the  go  mode  or  a  plus \n [Music] \n 1,000  they  need  something  again  they \n need  to  get  back  on  track  back  to  that \n second  SEC  Rhythm  that \n pace  it's  only  one  break  it  feels  like \n more  now  because  they're  playing  better \n Quia  and  after  that  point  you  stay \n like  punched \n hurt  got  to  keep  going  and  now  Tapia \n dunking  it  but  not  going  over  the  fence \n for  quatra  on  the  other  side  of  the  net \n he  sends  it  to  his  own  place  and  it's \n like  a  casual  day  you  know  the  day  at \n the  office  for  Tapia  see  come  back  here \n baby  this  guy  I \n mean \n 405  first \n get \n [Applause] \n him  unlucky  for  Leon  small  touch  there \n at  the  net  going  straight  into  the  fence \n nice  P  from \n sta  post  and  in  from  Tapia  that  counts \n that \n counts  going  to  have  a  better  look  here \n if  you  go  out  you  touch  the  post  and \n then  it  goes  in  it's  a  point  for \n you  it's  a  point  for  you  another  shot \n for  the  highlights  you're  going  to  make \n a  highlight  shot  highlight  real  only  out \n of  tapus  shots  today  in  the  finals \n going  to  Tik  Tok  going  to \n Instagram  important  game  this  one \n especially  for  stone  I  know  the  break \n could  be  too \n much  me  hit  from \n aruro  going  for  the \n smash  and  again  the  love  over  the  king \n is \n paying  L  over  at  Duda \n [Applause] \n works  that's  a  good  way  to  redeem \n yourself  after  having  a  mistake \n good  comeback  from  Muro \n [Music] \n great  Point  again  for  coot  Tapia  playing \n little  games  and  you  cannot  play  the \n games  with \n Tapia  this  could  be  too  much  this  could \n be  too  much  but  it's  not  going  to  happen \n just  yet  qu  Tapia  missing  the  return \n he's  a  Human  After  All  not  a \n machine  this  match  it's \n good  of  the  match  from  Leon  and  also  the \n tournament  going  back  to  the  right  side \n of  the  court  it's  a  different  monster \n there  an  absolute  killer  from  the  right \n side  of  the  Court \n he's  at  100%  he  can  be  within  the  top \n four  easily  now  PES  but  it's  going  to  be \n easy  it's  going  to  be  more  than  easy  for \n Tapia  the  problem  with  a  PES  at  this \n level  whenever  you  go  to  a  club  and \n you're  playing  with  your  friends \n probably  you  go  and  you  play  a  PES  and \n it's  going  to  be  most  likely \n point  at  the  pro  level  whenever  you  play \n a  portes  and  if  it  doesn't  open  too  much \n if  you  don't  have  a  lot  of  power  they \n will  be  waiting  for  you  just  to  tdge  the \n ball  to  the  land  and  kill  the  point \n [Applause] \n Advantage \n super  okay \n [Applause] \n theet  paying  a  big  part \n nowed  a  big \n actor  one  for  LeBron  stupa  now  one  for \n Tapia  and  aruro  and  I  remember  talking \n to  a  couple  coaches  Martin  Carell  one  of \n them  explaining  that  it's  not  a \n coincident  that  we're  witnessing  more \n and  more  course  touching  the  net  shows \n you  how  close  the  players  are  executing \n the  shots  how  precise  they  are  how  thin \n the  ball  goes  and  obviously  as  precise \n and  thin  that  you  get  more  chance  you \n have  to  touch  the \n net  happy  finding  the  net  and  the  first \n game  of  the  third  set \n for \n up \n [Music] \n fore \n [Music] \n fore  no \n no  foree \n [Music] \n [Music] \n enjoying  the  finals  of  the  r  season \n P1  thanks  for  joining  the  broadcast  what \n a  match  it's

returns  today  from \n stupa  and \n Leon  not  even  playing  the \n point  just  like \n that  less  than  a  minute  Tapia  and  coo \n collecting  and  picking  up  another \n game  he  is  a  wizard  Tapia  he  is  an \n absolute  wizard \n behind  the  back  aruro  goo  joining  the  F \n but  that's  going  to  be  more  than  easy \n for  Franco \n stas  dunking  it  for \n quatro  beautiful  shot  though  from  aruro \n saving  it  put  close  to  his  fit \n and \n again  and  again \n papia \n 5  creating  some  Unstoppable  angles \n moving  stupa  even  though  after  the \n effort  from  stupa  to  give  one  more  shot \n to  force  uro  to  win  The  Point \n again  they  reply  the  number  ones \n communication  is  key  this  time  it  was \n Leon  the  war  telling  stupa  not  to  even \n touch  the  ball  not  to  even  think  about \n it \n 405  4 \n 15  that's  what  you  got  to  do  you  know \n you  have  to  play  so  precise  to  be  so \n close  to  the  net  that  you're  going  with \n the  back  end  as  soon  as  you  don't  be \n smart  enough  with  a  chikita  St  so  quick \n that  he's  going  to  be  close  to  then  I  to \n block  it  and  reclaim  the  attacking \n position  43 \n fore \n big  jump  from  uro  but  not  good  enough \n Unstoppable  that  smash  from \n franasia  32  still  a  break  up  trying  to \n get  for

over \n aruro  the  love  over  atudo  was  working \n during  the  second  set  they're  not  using \n it  the  third  one  so  back  to  that \n original  plan  back  to  sending  some  LS \n over  aruro  coo  and  then  stupa  was  saying \n yes  but  once  we  go  over  aruro  we  have  to \n make  him  play  of  an  excellent  to  our \n perfect  B  we  cannot  miss  after  winning \n the  net \n approaching  the  end  of  the  first  final \n of  the \n Season  stoa  flying  and  Lon  smashing  it \n hard  5  good \n combination  mod  paddle  the  back  inside \n player  building  the  point  and  assisting \n the  right  side  player  to  finish \n we  always  say  that  the  right  side  player \n usually  is  the  Strategic  one  the  one \n setting  up  the  pace  and  the  point  in \n order  for  the  backend  to  finish  to  be \n the  one  finishing  the  point  aggressive \n was  the  opposite  and  this  time  again \n copy  paste  le  iton  le  it  on \n Leon  153 \n [Music] \n 30  go  Point  moment  running  St  but  trying \n to  get  the  break \n back  that's  the  L  that  we're  talking \n about  over  aruro  making  play  they  send \n him \n back  always  TOS  Areo  this  time  the  L  was \n a  glass  fighter  it  was  too \n long  it's  working  it's  working  quo  is \n not  doing  anything  with  the \n overheads  it's  not  war  him  anymore  he's \n not  going  to  go  for  the  smash \n and  it's  an  open  door  to  go  there  and  to \n force  them \n [Music] \n back  and  again  the  net  and  again  and \n again  and  again  the  net  today  we've  seen \n a  lot  of \n those  it's  a  dece \n unfortunate  last  fighter  and  now  opening \n the  racket  trying  to  get  some  uh \n different  movement  different \n motion  look  at  that  for  quatro  from  coo \n as  cheeky  as  you  can  be  on  the  Finish \n the  rainbow  shot  isn't \n it  stepping  closer  and \n Bam  quatro  climbing  the  fence \n over  going  for  a  walk  here  re  at  that \n ball  game  for  TAP  42  and  Le  already \n serving  again  how  smart  boo  is  to  wait \n for  that  ball  he  knew  that  the  ball  was \n not  too  high  so  he  placed  it  Cross  Court \n slicing  it  going  towards \n sta  L \n 15  we  Downs  probably  because  of  the  spin \n that  stup  was  using  that \n Banda  soon  as  the  ball  goes  down  it's \n going  to  jump \n going  for  the  kick \n smash  using  the  spin  from  the  Contra  and \n after  a  Long  Point  St  saying  hash  now \n more  bye-bye  Chow \n noos  see  you \n [Music] \n [Applause] \n later  take  that  Tapia  4050  take  that \n one  stup  with  no  mercy  at \n allia  just  getting  the  racket  for  some \n protection  there's  absolutely  nothing \n you  can \n do  apologizing  sta \n sportsmanship  what  a  match  from  stupa \n and  Leon  so  solid \n okay  now  Tapia  is  the  one  punishing \n LeBron  LeBron  finding  the  end  of  the \n Court  going  for  the  smash  but  living  a \n choice  foro  in  a  weird  point  it's  a \n lefty \n one  finding  the \n winner \n [Applause] \n for  you \n [Music] \n advantage  to  Utopia \n [Applause]

from  LeBron  and \n stupa  I  had  big  expectations  from  these \n two  when  they  announced  that  they  were \n playing  together  in \n 2025  so  far  it's  even  better  than \n expected  what  a  combination  I  think \n there  will  be  playing  many  many  finals \n winning \n tournaments  B  bam  bam  bam  B  bam  bam  the \n four  players  at  the  net  the  four  players \n at  the  net  but  sta  Dodges  at  going \n Matrix  mode  love  15 \n no \n [Music] \n 15  can  be  out  watch  it  keep  an  eye  on  it \n and  it  was  out  tapio  was  right \n 305  the  only  thing  that  tap  and  coo  have \n to  do  is  holding  the  serve  and  they  will \n be  the  champion  team \n RI  no  P  from  uroos  the  ball  staying  in \n 405  405  and  this  is  now  the  moment  where \n that  point  that  block  from  AIA  in  the \n 1540  at  the  beginning  of  the  first  set \n the  third  set  the  super  block  the  point \n of  the  tournament  now \n how  important  it  is  how  that  break  could \n be  that \n decider  43  putting  too  much  power  in \n that \n volley  good  move  though  the  ball  was \n high  he  tried  to  go  closer  to  an  head  to \n attack  and  he  placed  it  too \n low \n dancing  dancing  Leon  to  DOD  a  ball  good \n moves  in  defense  and  stupa  and  LeBron \n they're  showing  something  else \n today  stupa  going  quick  to  the  net  to \n avoid  the  the  bounce  then  LeBron \n dancing  sta  flying  high  and  forcing \n Tapia  to  make  the  unforced \n [Music] \n error  Advantage \n [Music] \n yeah  is  I  mean  did  you  see  how  fast  he \n went  from  the  back  line  to  the  net  to \n block  that  shot  from  Alia  but  this  guy \n is \n flying  this  ball  oh  dur \n [Applause] \n midle  goes  the  crowd  here  in  the  panel \n Rush \n Arena  Leon  going  for  the  smash  both  and \n going  for  it  almost  like  two  trains \n colliding  but  it  was  good  enough  to  dunk \n it  I  don't  even  know  it  was  sto \n super  flying  to  the  net \n what  a  pick  up  from  Leon  from  the  autog \n ground  from  the  lead  Metra  station  but \n then  quick \n from  no  protection  whatsoever  for  stupa \n at  the  net  every  single  point  has  a \n class  touch  shows  the  skills  and  the  the \n talent  from  these  four  players  what  a \n final  what  a  way  to  end  the  first \n tournament  of  the  season \n [Music] \n power  pure  power  every  single  time  he \n goes  for \n the  finds \n something  going  below  the  ball \n underneath  it  to  create  the  angle  to \n place  the  racket \n down  look  at \n that  those  are  the  ones  advantage \n again  so  many  free  points  for  Co  Andia \n coming  from  STA  and  LeBron  today  and  he \n knows  how  important  that  was \n [Applause] \n good  ball  Jaso  flipflop  shot  from  AIA \n and  the  winner  to  make  it  53  and  the \n number  ones  are  only  one  game  away  from \n the \n

Miami \n everyone  was  asking  is  that  the  right \n choice  is  he  going  to  deliver  and \n perform  as  he  always  does  and  coo  said \n it  in  an  interview  before  this \n tournament  this  opener  this  season \n opening  we  had  is  a  big  big  proof  to  me \n and  for  the  rest  to  show  them  that  I  can \n do \n it  trying  to  cover  the  middle \n so  unpredictable  sta  you  never  know  if \n it's  going  to  play  the  rule  if  he's \n going  to  go  with  a  soft  Anda  down  the \n middle  what  a  jump  from  aapi  and  then \n dodging  the  fence  now  the \n block  and  the  Finish  from  LeBron  I \n mean  the  level  and  the  P  that  we're \n witnessing  today  look  at  this  jump  from \n AIA  not  only  catching  it  high  but  also \n then  going  down  to  miss  the \n fence  unreal  I  missed  P  paddle  so  much  I \n missed  it  so \n much  moving  the  rest  flicking  it \n [Music] \n [Music] \n and  behind  the  back  he  try  to  go  for  the \n crazy  recovery  AIA  he  was  out  of \n position  he  thought  the  ball  was  going \n fores  at  the  end  he  realized  that  it  was \n not  going  out  of  the  Court  he  came  back \n he  took  it  but  at  the  end  he  was  out  of \n guard  going  for  the  fake  smash  to  B  too \n soft \n [Music] \n the  fans  giving  tapy  another  chance  and \n he  will  take \n it  close  to  going  P  Quadra  that  smash \n from  sta  he \n didn't  going  straight  into  Tapia  and \n Tapia  smashing  it  hard  The  Punisher \n Tapia  going  for  the  match  point  the \n

after  a  long \n week  be  at  the  Champions  are  here  the \n first  one  of  the  season  winning  this \n tournament  for  the  first  time  they  lost \n a  final  one  year  ago  and  here  they  are \n getting  even  more  points  and  we're \n defending  only  the  points  from  the \n finals  and  they  will  get  an  extra  amount \n of  points  in  the  rankings  making  that \n difference  between  them  and  the  rest \n even  bigger  big  shout  out  to  stupa  and \n Leon  for  the  entire  tournament  they \n played \n also  an  impressive  match  an  impressive \n performance  today  been  close  being \n really  close  but  at  at  the  end  of  the \n day  it's  always \n them  it's  always  them  it's  always \n yunia  a  big  hog  that  says  it  all  and  a \n big  thank  you  to  you  watching  from  the \n other  side  of  the  screen  following  the \n entire  Tournament  being  patient  with  the \n rain  delays  but  always  supporting  the \n tour  always  supporting  the  players  and \n this  final  shows  all  the  support  also \n from  the  players  to  you  show  showing  on \n court  how  good  they  are  in  making  us \n have  a  lot  of \n [Music] \n fun  the  number  one's  getting  the  first \n tournament  of  the \n season  in  a  few  minutes  we'll  have  a \n look  at  the  numbers  the  stats  the  stats \n the  match  summary  and  we  will  have  the \n trophy  ceremony  here  live  with  all  of \n you \n and  coo  said  it  I  was  uh  trying  to  send \n also  a  message  to  the  people  questioning \n my  decision  to  go  to  Miami  or  am  going \n to  get  the  best  results  I'm  I  going  to \n be  able  to  perform  as  I  was  doing  it \n when  I  was  living  in  Spain  well  I  think \n the  answer  is  pretty  clear \n clear  and  choto  Alan  also  will  have  to \n keep  an  eye  on  stupa  LeBron  they \n were  closing  the  quarterfinals  losing  to \n W  and \n Cardona  and  just  like  that  stupa  and \n LeBron  are  in  the  conversation  in  that \n race  for  the  number  two  spot  in  the \n rankings \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n seems  like  now  kab  has  some  pain  in  one \n of  his  uh  right  hand  fingers  getting \n some  protection  now \n [Music] \n AIA  in  my  opinion  the  MVP  of  the  match \n today  aruro  was  not  playing  at  his  best \n but  whenever  Tapia  is  playing  good  and \n the  goo's  not  or  the  opposite  it's \n enough  to  win  championships  Bella  said \n it  Fernando  said  it  a  couple  of  weeks \n ago  the  thing  making  these  two  special \n is  that  even  when  they're  playing  70% \n 60%  they're  able  to  win  and  when  one \n player  is  not  having  the  day  or  bringing \n the  a  game  the  other  one  is  pushing  the \n team  and  that's  the  key  the  combination \n to  Perfection  these  two  have  uh  found \n something  they're  making  history  they're \n young  and  they  have  a  lot  of  years  ahead \n of  them  it's  hard  to  believe  that \n somebody's  uh  taking  the  number  one  away \n from  them  anytime  soon  it  can  happen  of \n course  it  can  happen \n but  it's  hard  it's  hard  it's  really  hard \n these  two  are  a  fantastic  Duo  they \n friends  they  perform  well  on  court \n whenever  they  have  free  time  they  also \n spend  time \n together  and  that's  the  main  reason  why \n they're  just  winning  and  winning  and \n winning  breaking \n records  they  could  become  perfectly  one \n iconic  pair  in  the  history  of
