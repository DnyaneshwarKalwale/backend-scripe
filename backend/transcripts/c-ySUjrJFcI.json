moment  I'm  out  I'm  honestly  kind  of  sad \n because  I  think  I  could  have  made  it  far \n if  it  wasn't  for  something  so  unlucky \n like  the  umbrella  cookie  and  I  literally \n mean  unlucky  like  nobody  was  able  to  do \n it  but  it  is  what  it  is  and  what's  so \n cool  is  that  we  can  actually  sit  here \n and  watch  them  continue  to  compete  on \n these

like  on  the \n corner  so  I  went  I  want  you  to  know  we \n we  like  stopped  ourselves  from  eating  to \n wait  for  you  it's  like  half  done  yeah  I \n know  you  could  have  finished  it  by  now \n you're  welcome  this  is  what  true \n friendship  looks  like  here's  me  food  my \n reward  for  doing  a  Mr  Beast  shoot  the \n hardest  work  in  the  world \n so  rich  this  guy  is \n Rich  thanks  for \n watching  here  are  my  final  thoughts \n regarding  the  whole  Mr  Beast  shoot  for \n starters  I  legit  cannot  thank  him  and \n his  team  enough  for  inviting  me  I'm  not \n going  to  lie  like  it's  a  bit  of  an  ego \n boost  to  get  invited  to  these  things  you \n know  like  these  top  YouTuber  things  like \n me \n okay  really  it's  so  fun  and  it's  such \n like  a  unique  experience  this  felt  like \n a  field  trip  just  for  Content  creators \n SL  YouTubers  which  is  so  so  cool  it  was \n also  so  fun  to  get  to  interact  with \n other  creators  that  I  would  never  have \n gotten  to  meet  otherwise  especially \n people  who  are  from  other  countries  like \n people  in  Europe  or  UK  like  KSI  and  all \n his  group  of  friends  but  to  be  honest \n with  you  guys  it  was  also  a  really \n really  big  reminder  of  what  it  means  to \n be  at  the  top  of  the  YouTube  game  and \n I'm  not  saying  that  I  am  I'm  really \n really  not  I'm  saying  like  I  got  to  see \n these  huge  creators  in  person  and  you \n really  get  to  tell  like  how  much  they're \n constantly  thinking  about  content  about \n keeping  up  with  the  algorithm  about \n coming  out  with  the  next  video  or  piece \n of  content  and  really  how  busy  it  makes \n their  lives  it's  like  even  when  they're \n on  the  job  they're  like  double  on  the \n job  when  they're  off  the  job  they're \n still  thinking  about  making  content  so \n it  really  gave  me  a  lot  of  appreciation \n for  all  the  effort  that  they  put  in  but \n also  in  another  way  like  it  really  is \n all  about  content  you  know  we  were  all \n walking  around  with  our  subscriber  count \n on  our  backs  and  people  are  kind  of \n making  jokes  about  it  like  ooh  the  under \n 5  million  club  or  the  over  5  million \n club  and  a  lot  of  it  was  in  good  fun  but \n one  guy  was  like  yeah  they  put  our  sub \n count  on  our  backs  so  that  we  know  our \n worth  as  a  human  being  and  of  course  he \n was  saying  it  ironically  but  I  couldn't \n help  but  like  ey  twitch  like  H  do  you \n kind  of  mean  that  cuz  some  people  really \n do  think  that  but  luckily  a  kid  you  not \n everybody  was  really  nice  regardless  of \n how  of  a  Creator  they  were  no  one  was \n weird  nothing  weird  happened  behind  the \n scenes  or  in  front  of  the  scenes  as  you \n would  see  in  the  video  I  met  so  so  many \n dope  people  that  were  far  from  like  the \n largest  creators  ultimately  it  was  super \n fun  such  a  cool  experience  and  I  hope \n I'll  get  to  experience  more  things  like \n that  in  the  future  thank  you  again  to  Mr \n Beast  and  his  team  of  like  10  billion \n people  I  don't  know  it  really  takes  a \n village  to  come  out  with  a  video  like \n this  like  I'm  pretty  sure  this  video \n cost  the  million  milons  of  dollars  and \n I'm  not  talking  about  the  cash  prize  or \n whatever  isn't  that  crazy  so  please  go \n watch  it  I  mean  I'm  sure  you  already \n have  thank  you  for  watching  this  one  if \n you  do  and  I'll  see  you  in  the  next  one \n bye \n
