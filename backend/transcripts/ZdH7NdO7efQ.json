  "transcript": "My  name  is  Andrew  and  I  can  type  at  150 \n words  per  minute.  This  is  Marquez.  How \n fast  can  you  type?  121.  Uh,  I've  seen \n better  from  you.  But  I've  created  six \n exercises  that  can  make  you  at  home  type \n as  fast  as  both  of  us.  Three  of  them  are \n super  simple,  proven.  In  fact,  everyone \n at  the  studio  did  them,  and  you'll  see \n those  results  at  the  end  of  the  video. \n Other  three  of  them  are  a  little  more \n mad  sciency,  and  I'm  hoping  it  can  make \n you  better  in  like  less  than  10  minutes. \n All  right,  so  this  is  Tim  and  Adam,  and \n they've  been  so  kind  to  let  me  run  a \n couple  tests  on  them.  Now,  I've  come  up \n with  a  couple  ideas,  and  I  think  I  can \n make  their  typing  speeds  improve  in  just \n a  couple  minutes.  But  first,  we're  going \n to  have  to  take  a  couple  control  tests \n just  to  what  we're  working  with. \n Explode.  Wait,  we'll  do  it  again. \n Three,  two,  one,  go. \n H.  That  was  not  good.  Okay.  Okay.  Not \n too  bad,  you  guys.  Did  I  win?  No.  What? \n You're  not  that  far  off.  You  beat  him. \n Um,  but  we've  got  lots  of  room  for \n improvement.  So,  let's  do  our  first \n test.  So,  right  off  the  bat,  so  the \n first  of  these  three  challenges,  I've \n had  this  idea  in  my  head  that  correlates \n to  baseball.  In  baseball,  you  used  to \n see  batters  warm  up  with  these  weighted \n bats  before  they  got  to  the  plate.  So,  I \n thought  if  I  make  somebody  a  weighted \n keyboard,  maybe  after  warming  up  on  that \n weighted  keyboard,  when  they  go  to  a \n normal  one,  we  could  see  a  faster  speed. \n So,  these  are  two  almost  identical \n keyboards,  except  I  swapped  all  of  the \n springs  out  of  this  one.  So,  it  actually \n requires  three  times  the  actuation  force \n to  press  a  key.  That  one's  also  orange. \n Tell  me  when.  Adam,  this  is  your  heavier \n keyboard.  You're  going  to  take  a  30 \n second  typing  test  and  then  immediately \n after  we're  going  to  swap  to  this  one \n and  take  a  15-second  test  to  see  what \n our  results  are.  Oh  my \n god.  What  the \n dude?  This  is  a \n workout.  Oh,  come  on.  64  words  per \n minute.  So,  we're  only  two  slower  than \n you  were  before. \n He's  locked  in.  Sorry.  He  doesn't  even \n have  any  Saratoga  water.  That's  crazy. \n He's  going  to  get  like  100  71.  So,  a \n little  bit  slower,  but  let's  see  what \n happens. \n Oh \n my.  This  is  way  easier,  but  I  just  suck \n at  typing. \n 75.  Okay,  look  at  there.  What?  That's  10 \n more  words  a  minute  before.  Honestly, \n rookie  sensation  Tim  McMahon  at  the  bat. \n It  actually  sounds  like  you're  on  a  mic \n right  now.  It's  weird.  Okay.  Not  great. \n Actually  worse  than  your  weighted  test. \n So,  the  weighted  test  didn't  quite  go  as \n planned.  Um,  but  I'm  not  really  that \n surprised  because  the  whole  baseball \n weighted  bat  thing  was  debunked  in  like \n 2011.  So,  that's  on  me.  As  much  as  the \n results  didn't  work  for  Adam,  I  actually \n think  that  test  helped  him  more  than  he \n thought  because  he  didn't  look  at  his \n keyboard  at  all.  What  I  really  wanted \n them  to  focus  on  was  the  accuracy  and \n focusing  on  each  individual  key  press. \n Kind  of  like  creating  a  harder  muscle \n memory.  And  a  way  you  can  do  that  at \n home  is  actually  this  website  called \n keybr.com.  This  website  is  phenomenal, \n especially  if  you're  just  learning  how \n to  type.  All  you  have  to  do  is  take  this \n test  and  QBR  realizes  kind  of  the \n letters  and  the  areas  of  the  keyboard \n that  you're  struggling  in  and  then  feeds \n you  personalized  tests  to  get  better  and \n more  comfortable  with  typing  without \n looking  at  your  keyboard.  So,  for  our \n next  test,  I've  created  arguably  the \n most  visually  distracting  typing  test \n possible.  And  what  I'm  looking  for  is \n for  you  guys  to  focus  on  what  you  need \n to  type  rather  than  how  you're  typing. \n And  we're  going to  take  a  30  second  test \n of  that  and  then  we're  going  to  come \n back  and  take  another  normal  test  and \n see  if  we  see  any  changes.  Okay.  All \n right.  Ready?  Three,  two,  one. \n What  in \n I  What  is  happening? \n Okay.  Okay,  cool.  Well,  that  was \n impossible.  Let's  see.  48  words  a \n minute.  That's  actually  pretty \n consistent.  That's  really  good.  You \n found  your  groove  there.  Let's  see. \n Adam,  26  words  a  minute.  That's \n pretty  works.  Three,  two,  one. \n Uh,  I  did  worse  than  that  last  test. \n Okay,  so  what  we're  learning  so  far  is \n Adam's  really  good  at  games  and  focusing \n on  what  to  do  better.  And  Tim  under  the \n pressure  might  not  be  doing  quite  as \n good  for  Tim.  That  was  just  kind  of  a \n tough  one  yet.  We'll  get  him  next  time. \n So  Monkey  Type,  which  personally  I  think \n is  the  best  typing  website  on  the \n planet,  has  this  amazing  set  of  settings \n and  a  place  called  Funbox,  which  has  a \n bunch  of  different  special  modes  you  can \n do.  So  there's  stuff  like  nausea  and \n arrows  and  choo  choo  that  kind  of  just \n send  everything  flying.  But  if  you  want \n something  a  little  more  practical,  the \n read  ahead  mode  is  super  useful.  So  the \n most  practical  mode  is  called  read \n ahead.  And  it's  really  fun  because  it \n actually  hides  the  next  word  as  you're \n typing,  which  kind  of  forces  you  to  have \n this  muscle  memory  for  almost  every  word \n in  the  dictionary.  So  the  more  you \n practice,  you  read  the  word,  your \n fingers  start  typing  it,  and  you're \n already  reading  the  next  word.  On  Monkey \n Type,  if  you  want  to  practice  your \n muscle  memory,  you  can  actually  make  a \n custom  test  that  includes  words  you  type \n all  the  time,  like \n this.  Subscribe  to  the  studio  right  now. \n So  for  our  last  test,  we're  going  to \n focus  on  sound.  So  typing  is  like  a  flow \n state.  You  need  to  be  in  a  rhythm.  You \n need  to  be  in  a  groove.  If  you  go  into  a \n typing  test  trying  to  be  Max  Versappen, \n you're  gonna  get  Lance  Stroll  results.  I \n don't  get  that  reference.  Thank  you. \n What  if  we  could  artificially  improve \n the  groove  you're  in  with  some  music? \n You  know,  music  has  beats  per  minute, \n typing  has  words  per  minute.  If  we \n increase  the  beats  per  minute,  can  we \n increase  your  words  per  minute?  That \n logic  is  flawless.  I  don't  see  how  it \n could  fail.  I  set  both  of  you  up  with  a \n one  minute  typing  test.  We're  going  to \n play  the  music.  You're  going  to  start \n typing  and  we're  going  to  look  at  the \n graph  afterwards  to  see  if  your  speed's \n increased  throughout  the  one  minute. \n When  you  hear  the  music,  you  may  start. \n 3  2  1 \n [Music] \n [Music] \n [Music] \n How'd  you  do?  That  was  rough.  Really \n bad.  51.  So,  you  know,  longer  tests  are \n going  to  have  slower  scores.  72.  72.  But \n I  think  we  could  argue  that  it  started \n pretty  slow  and  we  gradually  got  up.  You \n know,  you  you  fluctuated  in  the  start \n and  you  got  in  your  groove.  And  look  at \n this.  Like  if  you  took  from  here  on, \n yeah,  you'd  probably  be  in  80  to  90. \n Tim,  how'd  you  do?  Uh,  it  got  worse.  You \n were  very  consistently  terrible  through \n most  of  it.  You  know,  you're  really \n screwing  up  my  test  here,  man. \n We  set  them  up  at  120  beats  per  minute. \n And  while  we  didn't  see  like  direct \n number  results,  if  you  actually  look  at \n the  graph,  you  can  see  it  steadily \n rising  throughout.  And  and  you  could \n kind  of  see  when  Adam  was  typing,  he  was \n bobbing  his  head.  He  was  the  keyboard \n was  moving.  Everything  looked  really \n good  cuz  he  got  in  the  zone.  So,  I've \n realized  I  typed  the  best  when  I  kind  of \n get  into  a  flow.  And  and  music  can \n really  help  with  that.  But  I  also  kind \n of  want  to  think  of  a  keyboard  as  an \n instrument.  I've  heard  musicians  say \n things  like,  \"I'm  never  not  playing  my \n instrument.\"  Driving,  boarding  class, \n they're  visualized  playing  something \n like  a  saxophone,  their  drums,  their \n piano.  So,  if  you  can  do  that,  why  can't \n you  do  it  with  a  keyboard?  On  my \n commute,  sometimes  I'll  listen  to  a  song \n and  just  be  typing  the  lyrics  out  in  my \n head.  Does  that  sound  dumb?  Yeah,  I  I \n know  it  does.  And  I'm  fine  with  it,  to \n be  honest.  But  maybe  I  was  a  little  too \n confident  in  how  fast  I  could  improve \n scores,  but  I  found  a  way  that \n guarantees  you  can  type  faster  within \n one  work  week.  Let  me  show  you  how.  Over \n the  last  work  week,  I  took  six  studio \n members  and  gave  them  some  more  serious \n exercises  to  improve  their  typing \n speeds.  And  I'm  super  happy  with  the \n results.  Each  workday,  they'd  spend  10 \n minutes  in  the  morning,  10  minutes  in \n the  afternoon,  doing  a  couple  exercises, \n and  then  would  take  a  test  at  the  end  of \n the  day.  And  we  recorded  all  their \n results.  And  to  my  surprise,  every \n single  one  of  them  improved.  And  not \n only  did  they  improve,  but  we  actually \n had  three  of  them  break  100  words  per \n minute  for  their  first  time  ever,  which \n was  cool  to  watch.  Two  of  them  almost \n doubled  their  scores.  If  you're \n interested  in  how  they  practiced,  I  left \n all  those  exercises  in  the  bottom  of  the \n video.  But  I've  got  one  more  thing.  Come \n here.  Since  I'm  still  the  fastest  typist \n in  the  studio,  I  like  to  make  sure  that \n everyone  here  knows  it.  You  know,  for \n team  morale,  thanks  to  today's  sponsor, \n Nebula.  What  do  you  think  of  that  score, \n Marquez?  Sheesh.  I  just  typed  that  with \n my  feet.  But  to  learn  a  little  more \n about  Nebula,  let's  move  over  to  our \n resident  projector  expert.  Thanks, \n Andrew.  This  is  a  4K  3500  anylm  triple \n laser  projector,  the  Nebula  X1,  which  is \n also  the  sponsor  of  today's  video.  Check \n this  out.  No  matter  where  you  use  this \n projector,  it  has  full  spatial \n adaptation  that  formats  the  screen.  And \n thanks  to  the  micro  gimbal  and  optical \n zoom  built  into  this  thing,  you  can \n freely  adjust  the  screen  to  fit  just \n about  any  wall.  If  it's  not  obvious  yet, \n this  thing  is  mobile.  We  have  the  X1 \n with  its  cinema  kit,  which  comes  with \n wireless  speakers  and  a  microphone.  And \n get  this,  with  those  two  speakers  in  the \n right  configuration,  you  can  actually \n play  back  4.1.2  audio  streams.  Speaking \n of  sound,  I  know  some  people  are  really \n worried  about  their  projector  being  too \n loud,  but  guess  what?  This  thing  uses \n liquid  cooling  to  get  quieter  fan \n speeds.  It's  cool  to  the  touch  no  matter \n where  you  touch  it.  The  X1  is  light, \n bright,  and  absolutely  packed  with \n features,  just  like  how  this  video  is \n packed  with  savings.  From  May  21st  to \n June  20th,  you  can  get  $700  off  their \n bundle.  And  if  you  like  this  video  and \n want  to  see  some  more  keyboards,  check \n out  the  desk  makeover  video  we  did  a \n couple  weeks  ago.",
