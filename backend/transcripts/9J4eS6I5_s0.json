  "transcript": "10  months  ago,  I  spent  $10,000  of  my  own \n money  buying  the  most  futuristic  tech \n products  from  Kickstarter.  But  because \n it's  Kickstarter,  only  half  of  them \n actually  arrived.  The  other  half  have \n ended  up  a  combination  of  companies \n who've  clearly  run  out  of  money  trying \n to  build  their  products  or  just  straight \n up  scammers  who  are  trying  to  rob \n people.  We'll  get  to  that.  But  the \n question  is,  are  the  products  that  did \n arrive  so  incredible  that  it  was  still \n worth  paying  that  insane  amount  of  money \n to  Kickstarter,  or  are  they  actually \n just  a  kick  in  the  teeth?  Kicking  things \n off  with  the  very  cheapest  one,  the  Roll \n Order.  And  I  can't  actually  believe \n this.  I  backed  this  product  thinking, \n \"Oh,  cool.  A  decently  fast  charger  with \n a  90  cm  retractable  cable  baked  inside \n of  it.  So,  you  can  always  have \n everything  you  need  without  the  cable \n taking  up  extra  space  or  getting  tangled \n in  a  bag.\"  I  paid  around  $40  for  this \n and  I  got  nothing.  If  you  back  a  product \n on  Kickstarter,  there  is  no  guarantee \n that  you  receive  that  product.  And \n you're  probably  thinking,  Aron,  it's \n right  here.  Like,  what  are  you  talking \n about?  This  is  the  crazy  part.  After \n nine  months  of  hearing  absolutely  zero \n from  this  company,  which  by  the  way  is \n enough  time  I  could  have  had  my  own \n child.  I  was  like,  let  me  just  look \n online.  They  listed  the  thing  on  Amazon. \n I  tried  buying  it  and  that  is  the \n product  that's  standing  here.  If  you  can \n even  call  this  standing.  I  mean,  this  is \n actually  how  the  thing  arrived.  Looking \n a  lot  less  like  roll  order,  a  lot  more \n like  rolled  over. \n But  honestly,  this  just  sucks  as  a \n company  practice  cuz  clearly  they've \n decided  we  didn't  make  as  much  money  as \n we  wanted  to  on  Kickstarter.  So,  they \n tried  selling  what  stock  they  did  have \n on  Amazon.  But  while  their  paid \n supporters  who  have  been  sitting  there \n right  from  the  very  beginning  are  still \n waiting  for  their  product  like  a  year \n later.  Also,  I'm  not  saying  this  just \n cuz  I'm  vexed  right  now,  but  this  just \n this  just  wasn't  worth  it.  The  product \n itself,  I  would  say,  feels  ah \n flip.  God  damn  it.  I  was  going  to  say \n feels  fine.  It  feels  like  a  decent \n quality  charger,  but  just  with  a  bunch \n of  small  red  flags.  Like  for  example, \n this  retractable  mechanism  doesn't  work \n all  the  time.  Because  you're  pulling  in \n the  same  direction  that  your  plug  faces, \n there's  a  pretty  good  chance  that  you \n will  also  pull  the  plug  out  in  the \n process.  It  uses  a  USBA  port  on  the \n front,  which  is  it's  giving  2019.  And  I \n think  most  fundamentally,  products  like \n this  have  already  been  made  by  other \n companies,  and  I  think  they've  done  it \n better.  So,  we're  not  exactly  on  a  roll \n with  Kickstarter  right  now,  but  let's \n keep  track  of  the  success  rate,  which  so \n far  is \n zero,  but  maybe  the  X  cutter  can  save \n it.  So,  this  is  the  ultimate \n multiunctional  box  opener.  Sounds  a  lot \n more  like  a  Pokémon  move  to  me,  but \n that's  not  actually  why  I  paid  for  it. \n I'm  constantly  when  I'm  opening  up \n boxes,  accidentally  also  slicing  the \n thing  inside  those  boxes.  But  this  is \n claiming  to  be  a  box  opener  that  never \n cuts  contents,  which  we  have  to  test. \n So,  this  is  what  you  get  for  basically \n $40.  Well,  you  can  tell  they  didn't \n spend  all  of  it  on  packaging.  And  inside \n is  some  ink.  This  is  for  the  overlay  pen \n on  the  other  side  of  the  thing.  And  then \n the  cutter \n itself.  The  thing's  apparently  got  10 \n functions  in  one.  Utility  knife,  saw, \n and  packing  tools.  Oh.  Oh,  that  that \n doesn't  count.  It's  kind  of  like  they \n ran  out  after  number  four,  but \n management  said  they  needed  10  on  their \n desk  by  tomorrow  morning.  Last  time  I \n checked,  made  of  titanium  is  not  a \n function.  So,  first  impression,  the \n mechanism  does  feel  very  responsive.  I \n really  like  that  the  blade  automatically \n retracts  unless  you're  actively  holding \n it  out.  It  makes  the  default  setting  it \n tucked  away,  which  feels  like  a  good \n safety  feature.  Although,  to  be  fair, \n you  can  actually  touch  it  with  your \n fingers  and  it  doesn't  feel  sharp.  Okay, \n let's  put  their  no  cuts  claim  to  the \n test.  So,  there's  two  boxes  here.  Each \n one  of  them  contains  one  of  my  rarest \n Pokémon  cards.  So,  normal \n knife.  That  didn't  feel  good.  And  now  X \n cutter.  Oh,  actually  did  a  lot  more \n dragging  of  the  card  inside.  I'm  not \n sure  that  was  good  for  either.  So,  for \n the  traditional  knife. \n Oh,  that's  quite  bad.  There's  a  very \n blatant  line  right  through  the  middle. \n And  now  the  X  cutter. \n Oh \n dear.  I  mean,  it's  not  better.  This  is \n too  much  pain  for  one  video.  Okay.  And \n then  on  the  other  side  of  the  X  cutter, \n we've  got  this  redacting  pen,  which  is \n made  to  basically  conceal  your  address \n details  before  throwing  out  these \n boxes. \n Uh,  okay.  I  mean,  yeah,  it  takes  a \n little  bit  to  get  going.  And  you  can \n kind  of  see  how  obscuring  this  ink \n actually  is,  but  it's  also  not  a  one \n swipe  and  your  problems  disappear  kind \n of  situation.  So,  is  this  actually \n straight  up  better  than  the  $100  knife \n that  I  use  for  pretty  much  all  of  our \n unboxing  so  far,  or  is  the  only  thing \n this  company  has  actually  cut  or \n corners?  Let's  keep  it  with  us  and  see \n how  it  fares  over  the  course  of  this \n video. \n So,  this  one  I'm  like  bursting  to  get \n inside  of  the  pencil  apple  pencil  tips, \n which  I  get  doesn't  sound  particularly \n interesting,  except  at  the  very  start \n when  I  misread  the  name  and  I  thought  it \n would  allow  your  Apple  Pencil  to  start \n dispensing  antibiotics  on  the  fly.  Then \n I  looked  at  it  properly  and  I  realized, \n wait  a  sec,  these  guys  are  claiming  to \n not  just  have  made  a  better  version  of \n the  Apple  Pencil  than  like  Apple \n themselves  with  these  replaceable  tips \n that  reduce  slipping  and  noise,  but  also \n tips  that  can  transition  straight  from \n writing  on  an  iPad  to  writing  on  paper. \n So,  it  comes  in  this  very  protected, \n almost  homemade  looking  outer  packaging. \n A  ribbon  on  the  outside.  Let's  get  rid \n of \n that.  Okay,  there's  another \n layer.  Sticky  tab  on  top.  Jeez  Louise, \n more  security  steps  here  than  my  bank \n account.  All right,  there  we  go.  This  is \n a  very  unique  looking  product.  So,  this \n is  what  it's  like  to  write  with  a  normal \n Apple  Pencil.  And  I  really  like  it,  to \n be  honest.  It's  very  hard  to  say  when \n using  this  that  there's  like  a  problem \n that  needs  fixing.  I  guess  you  could  say \n it's  a  little  on  the  loud  side.  Okay, \n let's  swap  out  the  normal  tip  for  a \n pencil  hybrid  tip.  I  mean,  on  the  bright \n side,  I  wouldn't  say  that  anything  is \n particularly  missing.  On  the  downside,  I \n also  wouldn't  say  that  this  adds \n anything.  Even  though  the  tip  is \n slimmer,  it  doesn't  feel  more  accurate \n because  of  that.  And  if  anything,  my \n handwriting  has  actually  gotten  worse \n with  this.  Then  this  should  be  the  crazy \n bit.  So,  a  real  piece  of  offline  paper. \n And  because  this  tip  is  made  of  a  carbon \n composite  material,  I  should  be  able  to \n transition  straight  from  writing  on  the \n iPad  to  writing  on  the  paper.  Holy  cow, \n that  actually  works.  That's  like  one  of \n the  coolest  party  tricks  that  I've  ever \n seen  a  tech  product  do,  but  I  hate  to  be \n this  guy.  Is  it  actually  a  great  pencil? \n So,  this  style  of  ultra  compact  nib, \n which  is  not  like  a  pencil  that  you  can \n just  keep  sticking  through  a  sharpener, \n it's  never  going  to  be  as  bold.  It  kind \n of  looks  a  little  bit  faint.  It's  got \n higher  friction  on  the  paper  than  a \n normal  pencil,  and  also  feels  just  like \n a  little  bit  blunt.  Curious  if  a  normal \n eraser  works.  Kind  of  uh  not  as  well  as \n I  would  want  it  to.  So,  to  draw  a \n conclusion,  I  think  all  things \n considered,  this  is  a  pretty  good \n product,  taking  us  to  a  50%  success  rate \n so  far,  but  I  also  wouldn't  quite  call \n it  a  best  of  both  worlds.  This  one  I \n thought  was  pretty  cool.  So,  six  AC \n outlets,  four  USB  ports,  15  watt \n charging,  light  sensor,  portable \n Bluetooth  speaker,  magnetic  wireless \n charger,  wall  mount  for  $49.  Basically, \n someone  made  a  real  life  AliExpress \n listing.  It's  the  weirdest  thing  because \n they've  put  out  this  full  update.  We \n wanted  to  take  a  moment  to  express  our \n heartfelt  thanks  to  each  and  every  one \n of  you.  It's  your  support  that's  made \n all  the  difference  and  helped  us  reach \n this  milestone.  But  then  they  didn't \n send  a  product.  Did  they  forget  that \n part  of  the  process?  And  then  the  entire \n comment  section  is  just  people  saying, \n \"Where  is  it?  I  want  a  refund.  Give  me \n an  update,  please.\"  And  no  one's  getting \n anything  back.  It  just  feels  crazy  that \n this  is  the  current  best  system  for \n supporting  upcoming  products  in  2025. \n So,  I've  actually  been  on  the  hunt  for \n the  perfect  sliders  for  quite  a  long \n time.  I've  been  through  Adidas,  I've \n been  through  Nike,  I've  been  through \n Crocs.  And  there's  always  something,  you \n know,  either  it  like  chafes  your  feet  a \n little  bit  too  much  or  it  keeps  coming \n off  as  you  take  your  steps.  And  that's \n why  I  was  also  really  drawn  to  this  one. \n This  is  the  most  comfortable  3D  printed \n shoe.  I  paid  $69  for  these,  which  first \n off,  nice,  but  also  that's  a  lot  for  a \n pair  of  sliders.  So,  they're  going  to \n have  to  be  quite  mind-blowing  to  be \n worth \n that.  Oh  god,  I'm  having  box  cutter \n problems.  Not  a  good  start  for  this \n thing.  The  whole  blade  has  just  come \n out,  right?  Bear  with  me  a  sec  while  I \n try  and  piece  this  together.  So,  the \n blade  rests  in  here.  The  pen  at  the \n other  end  goes  in  there.  And  then  this \n slots  back  in.  Okay.  Well,  this  does \n make  it  somewhat  better  that  at least \n when  it  does  go  wrong,  everything  seems \n designed  to  be  fixable.  So,  inside  our \n shoe  box,  we  got  a  branded  tote \n bag.  No  way.  A  keyring,  but  it's  like  a \n tiny  miniaturized  version  of  the \n slippers  I  ordered.  Actually,  Disha  can \n use  these.  What  a  weird  but  cool  extra. \n And  then  the  shoes  themselves. \n So,  here's  a  question  on  my  mind.  Why \n actually  3D  print  a  shoe  at  all?  Cuz  on \n first  glance,  I  was  like,  \"Oh,  maybe \n they'll  like  custom  mold  it  to  my  exact \n feet  shape.\"  But  they  didn't  do  that. \n What  these  guys  would  say  is  the  benefit \n of  3D  printing  is  the  ability  to  create \n this  3D  lattice  structure.  basically \n 360°  breathability,  washability,  but \n then  also  the  fact  that  the  structure \n will  kind  of  shift  as  you're  walking  on \n it  to  eliminate  the  pressure  points  that \n would  build  up  as  you're  walking  on  a \n normal  set  of  sliders  since  they  are \n just  basically  flat  planks  of  solid \n plastic.  So,  these  are  the  best  sliders \n that  I  have  yet  to  find  so  far.  And  I'd \n say  they're  very  comfortable.  Like, \n they're  quite  well  contoured  around  my \n feet.  They  do  make  a  little  bit  of \n noise,  a  light  thud  every  time  your  foot \n hits  the  floor  and  little  bit  squeaky. \n So  now  our  3D  printed  shoes. \n Oh,  that's  different.  I'm  walking  in \n 3D.  No,  but  seriously,  like  you \n absolutely  feel  the  way  that  the \n structure  moves.  You  can  actually  really \n feel  the  part  of  the  shoe  that  you're \n exerting  the  most  pressure  on  kind  of \n flexing  around  that  pressure,  which \n feels  good.  Oh,  yeah.  And  they're  also \n significantly  quieter.  This  is  actually \n so  therapeutic.  It's  like  there's  a \n thousand  tiny  really  soft  springs  just \n pushing  me  upwards  with  each  step.  It's \n kind  of  like  I'm  floating.  The  only \n thing  is  I  have  pretty  wide  feet  and  so \n this  part  of  the  structure  is  digging \n into  them  a  little  bit,  which  is  a \n problem  they  could  have  fixed  if  they \n actually  did  allow  you  to  custom  make \n them  for  your  feet.  But  still  pretty \n mad.  But  for  a  lot  of  people,  I  could \n actually  see  this  being  the  ultimate \n slider.  We  didn't  get  this  one,  did  we? \n Nope.  Damn.  So,  this  is  Solar  Energy  S, \n which  to  me  sounds  an  awful  lot  like  a \n low-level  Dragon  Quest  spell,  but  in \n reality,  it  is  a  40,000  mAh  power  bank \n with  the  ability  to  unfold  it,  revealing \n a  solar  panel  that  can  be  used  to  charge \n it  up.  Am  I  disappointed  that  it  didn't \n become  a  thing?  Yes.  Am  I  surprised?  No. \n Like,  not  even  in  the  slightest.  Even \n though  the  thing  raised  $40,000,  like \n the  number  of  times  in  a  conversation \n someone  has  suggested  to  me,  \"Oh,  we \n should  make  this  thing  solar  powered \n because  why  not?  It's  free  and  it's \n always  there.\"  Endless.  But  the  reality \n of  solar  is  that  like  it's  just  too \n inefficient  for  day-to-day  charging.  And \n so,  I'm  guessing  they  probably  got  far \n enough  along  in  the  process  of  this  to \n realize  that  it  sucked  and  then  also \n realize  that  without  the  solar  charging, \n this  product  already  exists.  And  the \n comment  section  is  even  more  brutal.  It \n looks  like  everyone's  trying  to  invoke \n some  sort  of  clause  to  get  their  money \n back  under  Kickstarter's  terms  of  use, \n but  I  don't  think  it's  going  to  work. \n Kickstarter's  current  stance  is  very \n much  like  if  you  have  a  problem,  it's \n not  our  problem.  So,  more  like  solar \n energy  l.  So,  that  was  $79  down  the \n drain.  Here's  another  $89  just  gone. \n This  one's  particularly  annoying  just \n cuz  of  how  cool  it  could  have  been.  So, \n it's  a  transparent  display,  but  unlike \n the  transparent  TV  that  I've  already \n reviewed  before,  this  one  has  a \n dedicated  space  behind  it.  So,  it's  kind \n of  designed  around  what  you're  using \n that  transparent  TV  to  display.  And  this \n is  one  of  those  ones  where  it  doesn't \n look  like  it's  a  scam.  They  say  they're \n preparing  to  ship,  even  if  they  have  had \n to  remove  the  LED  light  strip  from  all \n units  due  to  manufacturer  issues.  But, \n how  long?  Everything's  so  vague  on  this \n platform  that  if  you're  someone  who \n likes  certainty  like  me,  then  it  makes \n it  very  hard  to  like  plan  things  around. \n So,  I  know.  I  kind  of  wish  they'd  be  a \n little  more \n transparent,  but  now  we're  really \n kicking  things  up.  So,  this  product  had \n over  $100,000  raised.  The  Python  140  W \n mega  charging  hub.  Supposedly,  the \n charger  reinvented.  If  I  had  a  penny \n every  time  a  company  said  that.  Oh, \n yeah.  I  remember  why  I  backed  this \n thing.  So,  this  charger,  it  really \n genuinely  looks  like  the  level  1,000 \n Alpha  Chad  version  of  the  Anchor  Cube. \n That  was  like  my  favorite  charger  for  a \n full  2  years.  So  this  product  came,  but \n that's  also  not  the  least  bit  surprising \n because  Python  is  already  a  very \n established  company.  I  always  find  it  a \n little bit  weird  when  this  happens,  but \n you  can  also  see  why  it  makes  sense. \n Like  even  if  you  are  a  big  company  who \n knows  there  is  demand  for  a  product,  why \n not  also  just  list  it  on  another \n platform  where  people  can  buy  it, \n especially  if  it's  going  to  attract \n extra  eyeballs  like  Kickstarter  often \n does.  And  like  clearly  it  works.  This \n product  managed  to  hit  600%  of  its \n funding  goal  in  one  day.  Anyway,  right \n off  the  bat,  hot  damn,  this  is  a  cool \n finish.  Whole  thing  looks  almost \n holographic.  Ah,  right.  So,  one  extra \n thing  to  bear  in  mind  for  this  X  cutter \n is  it's  also  not  going  to  prevent  damage \n to  boxes  if  you're  cutting  the  plastic \n right  on  top  of  those  boxes.  One  more \n sticky  tab  over  here.  And  now  we're  in. \n It's  always  a  bit  of a  lottery  which \n side  contains  the  goods  and  which  one \n just  has  the  cables.  Well,  let's  go  for \n this  one.  Yay. \n Oh,  well  that's  directly  connected  to \n the  other  half  of  the \n box.  Why  do  I  even \n bother?  So,  it  definitely  doesn't  have \n portability  on  its  side.  We've  got  one \n Mag  Safe  connection  up  here.  So,  that's \n for  your  phone  and  that  is  completely \n adjustable.  Same  as  the  Anchor  Cube  at \n this  point.  One  thing  I  do  really  like \n is  they  give  you  one  of  these  magnetic \n rings  in  the  box.  So,  I  could  attach \n this  to  the  back  of  a  phone  that  doesn't \n have  magnets  on  and  make  anything  mag \n safe.  Now,  obviously,  it's  designed  for \n more  of  a  power  user  than  this.  You \n know,  you've  got  three  USBC  ports. \n You've  got  two  big  old  main  sockets  on \n either  side.  This  is  made  for  someone \n who  wants  to  power  every  single  thing  on \n their  desk  all  at  once.  But  I  also  can't \n help  but  feel  like  they  could  have \n learned  a  thing  or  two  from  this  cuz \n there  is  nothing  here  to  be  able  to \n charge  a  set  of  earphones  like  you  have \n embedded  inside  of  the  Anchor.  And  while \n there  is  a  charger  for  your  watch  that \n you  can  even  unscrew,  take  out,  put  on \n your  desk,  and  use  it  to  charge  like \n that.  And  then  you  follow  that  up  with  a \n USB  A  to  C  cable  there.  I'd  actually \n argue  that's  more  of  a  negative  than  a \n positive  because  with  this  kind  of  watch \n strap,  you  kind  of  have  to  remove  it \n every  time  you  want  to  charge  your \n watch.  And  this  is  not  a  very  elegant \n solution.  So,  I  would  say  the  product  is \n okay.  It's  exactly  what  it  says  on  the \n tin  and  nothing  more.  But  I  would  also \n say  this  is  a  prime  example  of  one  of \n the  benefits  that  you  do  get  on \n Kickstarter  that  if  a  product  you're \n backing  does  take  off,  there's  a  pretty \n good  chance  you're  going  to  pay  less \n than  you  would  at  retail.  Like  I  paid \n $99  for  this  one  and  the  RRP  now  is \n $179.99.  Okay,  two  more  that  didn't \n arrive.  The  first  is  this  $100  Foley \n smartphone \n expansion/  new  life  partner  cuz  one  of \n those  things  definitely  follows  from  the \n other.  And  why  have  they  crossed  out \n smartphone  expansion?  Like,  did  they \n change  their  mind  halfway  through?  To  be \n honest,  I  can  kind  of  see  why.  The  idea \n doesn't  make  any  sense.  It's  like  a \n power  bank,  but  one  that's  also  trying \n to  become  your  second  screen.  So,  they \n built  their  own  applications  inside  of \n this,  like  a  dialer,  like  a  remote \n control  for  your  phone's  camera,  like  a \n voice  recorder,  even  maps.  But  like,  not \n to  be  mean,  but  who  asked?  Like,  is \n there  a  single  person  on  this  planet \n who's  doing  any  of  these  things  on  their \n phone  who's  ever  said,  \"God,  I  just  wish \n I  could  kick  back  and  do  this  on  my \n freaking  power  bank.\"  Anyway,  the  latest \n update  here  is  just,  \"We're  working  hard \n for  mass  production.  We  still  have  some \n issues  to  solve.\"  Yeah,  you  do.  And  then \n my  second  L  was  even  more  expensive.  The \n Houthi  AI  pillow  at  $200,  which  just \n makes  me  really  want  to  go  lie \n down.  Except  I  can't  because  I  don't \n have  my  pillow.  So,  the  concept  is  this \n pillow  stops  you  snoring,  which  is  not \n in  itself  new.  Like,  you  can  already  buy \n pre-existing  pillows  that  detect  snoring \n with  a  microphone  and  then  move  your \n head  to  fix  it.  But  this  was  meant  to  be \n better  because  instead  of  a  mic,  it's \n using  bone  conduction,  which  should  be \n more  accurate  because  it's  only  going  to \n pick  up  those  noises  if  they're \n specifically  coming  from  you,  not  like \n your  rickety  old  fan  in  the  corner.  But \n again,  in  hindsight,  looking  at  this \n listing,  you  can  see  the  red  flags.  A \n new  generation  of  anti  snoring  pillows \n helps  you  deal  with  snoring  problems \n when  you  sleep.  The  definition  of  like \n Adobe  stock  footage  combined  with  text \n to  speech  engine. \n H  O  T  I  Sleep  Auntie.  They  can't  even \n say  their  own  brand,  right?  And  it's  not \n just  the  voice.  It's  like  they  never \n actually  show  a  working  demo  of  the  app \n itself.  The  only  thing  they  show  is  the \n pillow.  But  like  I  understand  how  a \n pillow  works.  The  only  footage  of  the \n app  in  this  trailer  is  footage  of  the \n app  not  working.  These  are  the  kinds  of \n things  you  should  be  looking  out  for  if \n you're  deciding  whether  or  not  to  back  a \n project.  This  next  one  is  almost  a \n little  bit  hard  to  believe.  So,  the  OITE \n battery  charger  and  checker,  which  just \n to  give  you  some  perspective,  while  the \n Apple  Pencil  tips  raised  $30,000  and  the \n X  cutter  raised  $69,000,  very  nice,  this \n battery  charger  raised  a  million.  So, \n this  is  the  packaging. \n Just  one  little  sticky  over  here.  Ah,  so \n this  is  another  issue  with  the  X  cutter. \n It's  not  quite  thin  enough  to  easily  get \n into  all  the  nooks.  Starting  to  feel  a \n little  more  situational  than  just  the \n knife  that  solves \n knives.  Oh,  this  this  right  here  is  my \n favorite  type  of  anti-static  bag.  You \n know  when  you  see  this  stuff,  you're \n about  to  have  a  good  time.  Listen  to \n this. \n exceptional.  So,  I've  got  a  dozen  or  so \n batteries  here  that  are  all  somewhat \n used.  And  the  idea  is  you  just  plop \n those  into  the  top \n here.  Let's  go  a  little \n nuts.  And  then  those  batteries  get \n funneled  down  into  the  middle  section, \n which  is  the  charging  station.  And  this \n is  the  really  cool  bit.  It  can  charge \n four  of  those  batteries  at  any  one  time. \n It  can  charge  from  empty  to  full  in  2 \n hours,  which  is  about  an  hour  quicker \n than  most  battery  chargers.  And  it \n doesn't  matter  which  way  around  that  you \n put  the  batteries  in.  It  can  charge  both \n orientations.  Okay,  look.  So,  this  is \n the  app  in  action.  It  will  tell  you  the \n exact  battery  percentage  that  each  of \n the  batteries  that's  currently  charging \n is  on.  You  can  schedule  the  charging, \n and  you  can  also  switch  between  standard \n and  fast \n charging.  Oh,  and  then  when  you  go  fast, \n you  can  really  hear  the  fan  kick  in.  And \n then  when  the  batteries  are  done \n charging,  they  should  just  fall  down \n into  this  bottom  section  here,  ready  to \n collect  and  use  again.  I  don't  think \n when  I  bought  this,  I  like  fully \n appreciated  how  cool  that  is.  Cuz  it's \n not  just  that  this  replaces  all  of  your \n different  battery  chargers.  This  also \n replaces  any  kind  of  organization  that \n you  might  normally  have.  And  I  love  how \n easy  they're  making  it  to  switch  over \n from  single  use  batteries  to \n rechargeables  like  this  cuz  I  mean \n that's  cheaper  and  it's  better  for  the \n environment.  So  it's  looking  very  good \n for  the  OITE.  This  is  definitely  a  Hall \n of  Fame  contender.  But  let's  see  how  it \n goes  over  the  course  of  this  video \n before  we  conclude.  Right.  Are  you  ready \n to  see  the  single  most  dead  on  arrival \n product  to  exist?  So,  this,  and  I \n actually  love  the  idea,  is  a  portable \n rig  that  upgrades  the  Nintendo  Switch \n from  outputting  in  720p  to  instead \n outputting  at  1080  by  adding  in  a  new \n external  display  that  basically  tricks \n the  Switch  into  thinking  it's  displaying \n on  a  TV.  And  it's  not  even  just  that.  It \n makes  the  controllers  feel  a  bit  more \n controller-like,  and  it  also  improves \n the  speakers.  I  actually  think  this \n thing  could  have  killed  if  it  launched \n in  2017.  But  the  microcond  that  the \n Nintendo  Switch  2  was  announced,  this \n makes  zero  sense.  I  mean,  that's  1080p \n with  none  of  the  hassle.  It  has  better \n controllers.  It  has  better  speakers \n along  with  about  100  other  benefits. \n Here's  the  thing  I'm  finding  really \n irritating  about  all  of  this,  though.  If \n you  go  on  to  the  updates,  they  have \n specifically  said  6  months  ago,  by  the \n way,  thanks  for  all  your  support.  We're \n going  ahead  with  shipping  as  planned. \n But  nothing.  I've  received  nothing.  So, \n so  far  at least,  Kickstarter  success \n rate  is  not  looking  great.  And  then  I \n also  backed  this  um  portable  shower.  I \n don't  know  why.  I  can't  speak  for  year \n ago,  but  I  spent  $250  and  this  one  says \n funding  suspended,  which  is  good  in  the \n sense  that  I  didn't  get  charged,  but \n still  feels  a  little  uh  you  Milly  18.  In \n better  news,  this  is  the  Uni  Herz \n Jellyax,  which  is  apparently  the  world's \n smallest  5G  smartphone,  although  it  says \n the  smallest  5G  smartphone  with  a \n question  mark.  So,  is  it?  I  actually \n doubt  it,  to  be  honest.  Isn't  this  also \n on  first  glance  a  little  bit  baffling  in \n the  sense  that  why  is  it  that  one \n Kickstarter  company  can't  seem  to  make  a \n tub  and  a  hose  and  this  one's  out  here \n making  entire  smartphones?  And  I  feel \n like  the  answer  to  that  is  there's \n actually  two  very  different  types  of \n companies  on  Kickstarter.  There's  the \n companies  who  I  guess  actually  need  the \n funding  and  those  are  the  ones  for  which \n clearly  there's  a  very  decent  chance \n you'd  never  actually  get  the  product, \n but  then  there's  also  this  huge  wave  of \n companies  like  this  uni  one  who  aren't \n like  that  but  just  use  the  platform  for \n extra  visibility.  So  given  how  small \n they're  biging  this  phone  up  to  be,  the \n box  is  a  little  on  the  chunky \n side.  Oh  no,  even  more  box  cutter \n issues.  It  just  can't  seem  to  handle \n cutting  things  at  anything  but  direct \n 90°  angles.  You  know  what?  I  think  we've \n tested  this  enough.  I  don't  think  this \n box  cutter  is  quite  the  revolution  I  was \n hoping  it  would  be.  Anyway,  back  to  this \n phone.  So,  we  take  the  top  layer \n off.  Oh,  okay.  Yeah,  it's  a  bit  bigger \n than  I  was  expecting.  And  damn,  why  is \n it  so  thick?  I  mean,  actually,  there  is \n a  case  pre-installed  on  there,  but  even \n without  that,  these  are  very  stodgy \n proportions. \n Okay,  I  stand  by  the  stodgginess \n comment,  but  at  the  same  time,  why  is \n this  like  the  most  comfortable  phone \n I've  held  in  years?  There's  something \n about  this  shape  that  actually  feels  way \n more  human  handd  designed  than  this \n shape.  Holding  both  of  these  side  by \n side  makes  you  realize  how  much  with  a \n normal  phone  you're  actually  stretching \n out  your  palm.  I  also  did  get  a  pretty \n decent  discount  supporting  on \n Kickstarter.  Like  I  paid  $259,  but  if \n you  were  to  go  onto  the  website  and  buy \n the  phone  now,  you  pay  $330.  So,  it's \n not  just  one  of  those  discounts  that's \n not  really  a  discount  that  gets  thrown \n around  willy-nilly.  And  for  $250, \n there's  actually  quite  a  lot  going  on \n here.  Like  very  decent  mid-range  specs \n all  around.  Pretty  large  4,000  mAh \n battery,  customizable  key  on  the  side, \n which  you  can  make  one  press  do  one \n thing,  a  double  press  do  another  thing, \n and  a  100  megapixel  camera,  which  does \n smell  an  awful  lot  like  number  bragging, \n but  let's  try  it.  So,  you  take  that  and \n then  take  an  iPhone  16  Pro \n Max.  You  have  no  spare  hands.  Okay,  you \n take  an  iPhone  16  Pro  Max  and  then  let's \n take  the  same  shot  on  Jelly  Baby  over \n here.  Oh,  wow.  Yeah,  it's  not  quite \n there,  is  it?  God,  processing  really  is \n everything  these  days.  So,  I  would  say \n there's  nothing  particularly \n mind-blowing  about  this,  but  it  does \n what  it  says  it  would  do  without  any \n major  real  red  flags.  So,  now  welcome  to \n the  next  and  thankfully  final  chapter  of \n Aron  loses  a  ton  of  money.  So,  I  paid \n $289  for  a  wind  tunnel.  Essentially,  a \n miniaturaturized  version  of  what \n engineers  would  use  to  test  the \n aerodynamics  of  cars  and  planes.  And  so, \n this  would  allow  you  to  do  those  same \n tests,  but  using  model  cars  and  planes. \n It  got  super  delayed.  And  then  they \n started  asking  for  more  money,  which \n happens  on  Kickstarter.  So,  I  just \n dipped.  And  then  the  Kung  Fu  Turtle.  So, \n this  is  one  of  those  desktop  robot  pets \n that  it  feels  like  we  see  around  all  the \n time.  It  looks  like  this  one  will \n eventually  be  released,  but  it  was  meant \n to  ship  in  November  last  year.  So, \n there's  a  point  at  which  it  becomes  an \n elf.  I  seem  to  remember  a  different  Kung \n Fu  Turtle  who  once  said,  \"There  are  no \n accidents.\"  But  this  is \n one.  Hey,  look  at  that.  If  I  want  my \n battery,  I  just  put  a  little  pressure \n here.  The  Lean  Pix  Cut  S1.  So,  this  is \n another  one  that  raised  almost  a  million \n dollars.  And  we  got  this  one,  although \n we  kind  of  had  to  get  this  one  because \n they're  sponsoring  this  video.  And  as \n far  as  sponsors  go,  I  don't  think  we've \n ever  had  a  cooler  product  because  this \n is  essentially  the  first  at  home  machine \n in  the  world  that  can  both  print  and  cut \n any  sticker  that  you  want  to \n make.  So,  let's  say  that  I  wanted  to \n keep  people  away  from  my  sliders  cuz  we \n are  actually  having  a  bit  of  a \n free-for-all  situation  in  this  house \n right  now.  Can  it  make  me  a  label  for \n it?  Okay,  say  that  looks  good  to  go. \n Make  it.  So,  first  it  prints  and  it \n prints  in  multiple  layers  to  make  sure \n that  each  color  comes  out  right.  It \n applies  a  protective  film  onto  the \n sticker.  Oh,  and  then  it  just  cuts.  That \n is  so  incredibly  satisfying.  And  so,  all \n I  need  to  do  now  is  to  peel  off  the \n sticker  and  then  stick  it \n down.  And  the  sticker  quality  feels \n really  high.  Like  this  X  cutter  isn't \n actually  even  scratching  it.  They're \n waterproof.  I  literally  used  this \n yesterday  to  print  out  my  own  dream \n phone  skin.  Moment  of  truth. \n Wow,  I  don't  deserve  this  kind  of  power. \n Link  below  to  check  it  out.  Oh  boy,  I  am \n so  glad  that  this  one  came.  So,  this  is \n apparently  the  world's  most  compact \n fullrange  vibration  speaker,  which \n doesn't  look  like  it's  capable  of  very \n much  at  all.  The  company  saying  that \n this  is  the  best  of  everything  because \n it  uses  vibration  sound  transfer \n technology  to  turn  the  surface  that  it's \n sitting  on  into  the  speaker  instead  of \n having  its  own  specific  inbuilt  sound \n chamber,  which  makes  the  audio \n completely  360°  and  the  thing  a  lot  more \n portable.  So,  we  peel  the  sticky  pad \n off.  That's  going  to  just  mean  that  you \n get  the  best  possible  connection  with \n the  surface  you're  putting  it  on. \n So,  part  of  the  issue  here  is  it's \n making  everything  on  the  table  vibrate, \n which  is  adding  a  lot  of  interference. \n So,  that  wasn't  exactly  a  success.  But, \n let's  try  putting  it  on  something  else. \n Let's  put  it  on  the  printer.  Cuz  that's \n the  interesting  thing  about  this \n speaker.  The  way  it  works,  it's  going  to \n sound  completely  different  depending  on \n what  object  it's  sitting \n on.  1930s,  is  that  you?  I  think  too  many \n moving  parts  there.  Let's  just  pull  up \n the  the  best  case  scenario  for  this \n speaker.  This  uh  this  IKEA  cabinet  has \n ended  up  being  one  of  the  most \n underrated  investments  we  ever  made.  So \n you  go  on  there  and  then  I  open  it  up. \n So  we've  got  a  big  wide  sound \n chamber.  Can  we  transition  this  off? \n Should  we  do  something  cool?  The  other \n aspect  of  this  that  they  keep  talking \n about  is  that  the  vibrations  are  meant \n to  be  soothing.  They  compare  it  to  one \n of  those  um  singing  bowls.  And  even \n right  here,  healing  through  sound  waves, \n but  honestly,  I  feel  like  that's  getting \n into  the  territory  of  buy  this  charger \n cuz  the  rounded  corners  bring  serenity \n to  your  existence.  Just  buy  a  normal \n Bluetooth  speaker.  The  price  for  them \n has  come  so  low  that  you  can  get  like \n amazing  sound  for  like  $30  to  $50.  Also, \n if  you  needed  any  more  signs,  it \n literally  has  BS  written  on  the  box. \n sums  up  the  average  state  of  the \n Kickstarter  product  so  far.  Okay,  we  can \n actually  keep  that  there  because  the \n next  product  is  the  chroma  plane.  It's  a \n synthesizer  played  using  pickups  that \n interact  with  electromagnetic  fields  to \n create  different  signals.  Or  to  put  that \n another  way,  these  madlads  have  gone  and \n created  an  entirely  new  musical \n instrument.  Yeah.  So,  this  this  right \n here  is  exactly  what  the  X  cutter  was \n meant  to  save  us  from.  But  for  now,  at \n least,  the  knife  feels  like  the  lesser \n of  two  evils.  All right.  So,  at  the  very \n top,  inspiration,  machines,  exploration. \n It's  making  me  feel  like  I  signed  up  to \n go  to  space,  not  paid  a  ton  of  money  to \n sit  in  my  basement  waving  magnets \n around.  We  got  a  little  postcard  with  a \n thank  you.  See,  it's  these  kinds  of \n personal  touches  that  I  imagine  is  what \n Kickstarter  buyers  are  seeking.  And  then \n here  is  our  very  unusual  looking \n product.  It's  very  funny.  It  looks  like \n one  of  those  old  DVD  players,  much  more \n than  it  looks  like  any  musical \n instrument  I've \n seen.  Ooh. \n I'm  going  to  take  you  to  a  special \n place.  What  did  he  say?  Not  in  a  weird \n way.  So,  the  closer  you  get  to  these \n marked  out  dots,  the  louder  the  notes \n play.  It's  very  therapeutic  and  it's \n like  it's  the  most  put  together  sounding \n experience  for  someone  who's  like  never \n interacted  with  this  instrument  before \n that.  You  give  someone  a  cello  for  5 \n minutes,  it's  not  going  to  sound  like \n this.  Kind  of  what  I  imagine  Heaven \n sounds  like.  Got  like  a  really  good  spa. \n Wait,  Kevin  is  having  connection  issues. \n So,  one  thing  it's  saying  you  can  also \n do  is  feed \n in  a  song  from  your  phone.  That  was \n magic.  How  did  When  did  that  appear?  So, \n the  music's  playing  as  I  get  closer  to \n this  one  dot  here.  And  then  I  can  live \n remix  that  with  all  these  other  dots. \n It's  not  Martin  Garrick's,  but  you  know, \n I  think  it's  fair  to  say  I'm  not  the \n target  market  for  this.  I  don't  really \n know  who  the  target  market  for  this  is, \n but  this  is  exactly  what  it  said  on  the \n tin.  I  knew  what  I  was  buying  and  it  has \n delivered  that.  So,  it's  one  of  those \n rare  examples  of  a  good  product  that \n isn't  from  one  of  those  big  companies \n and  was  made  possible  by  Kickstarter  and \n Kickstarter  only.  So,  we've  had  some \n pretty  strange  stories  already.  This  is \n the  strangest.  So,  this  is  the  gym  pad \n bench.  It's  one  of  those  all-in-one \n boxes  that's  trying  to  take  over  your \n entire  gym.  So,  we  bought  it  for \n $1,399,  by  the  way.  And  the  thing  did \n actually  ship  and  arrive.  So,  we're  all \n Gucci, \n right?  Yeah,  that's  not  happening.  Well, \n here's  the  issue.  This  product  doesn't \n work.  It's  a  kick  stopped,  if  you  will. \n So,  the  idea  is  this  part  is  your  bench. \n It's  very  comfortable.  It  feels  good. \n You  lift  that  up  and  then  inside  you \n have  to  push  this  part  out,  which  is \n slightly  confusing  because  it  actually \n says  pull,  but  you  there's  nothing  to \n pull.  And  then  you  get  to  lift  up  this \n dual  pulley  system.  Does  have  a  little \n bit  of  a  homemade  feel  to  it,  which  is \n not  exactly  what  you  want  when  you're \n buying  equipment  designed  to  test  your \n limits.  Now,  the  idea  is  you  raise  these \n to  whatever  height  you  want  depending  on \n the  exercise  you're  trying  to  do.  Okay, \n so  that's  locked.  This  all  feels  really \n stiff  and  not  in  like  an  intentional \n way.  And  then  pulling  this  system  in \n various  different  ways  is  essentially \n what  all  of  your  exercises  are  based  on \n cuz  underneath  this,  it's  got  a  way  to \n create  magnetic  resistance.  So,  I \n wouldn't  say  there's  anything \n particularly  wrong  with  the  concept  of \n the  product.  It's  just  that  we  can't \n power  the  thing.  We've  tried  like  five \n different  power  sources  that  we  know  for \n sure  are  working.  And  if  that  wasn't \n already  enough  of  a  red  flag,  just  look \n around  the  thing.  Like  these  pulleys, \n for example,  they're  in  the  locked \n position.  And  now  the  entire  bench  is \n shaking,  too.  The  dial  feels  really \n horrible  and  plasticky.  There's  the  fact \n that  we  specifically  paid  extra  to  have \n a  rowing  machine \n extension.  Where  is  it?  I  have \n absolutely  no  idea.  We  thought  we  were \n getting  weights  and  like  it's  not  a \n crazy  thought  given  that  they're \n literally  on  the  freaking  box.  It's  not \n even  called  the  gym  pad  bench.  They \n didn't  even  like  deliver  the  name  they \n said  they  were  going  to.  Clearly, \n they've  run  into  some  sort  of \n trademarking  issue.  But  the  point  is \n what  I  have  received  is  branded  Adop \n Pie.  So,  I  am  just  completely  baffled \n that  if  this  is  the  state  of  the \n product,  why  bother  sending  it?  Like  why \n not  just  either  take  the  time  to  finish \n it  or  like  scam  me  properly? \n Did  we  spend \n $4,899  on  a  single  Kickstarter \n product?  Yes,  we  did.  Should  you  spend \n $4,899  on  a  Kickstarter  product? \n Probably  not,  but  let's  find  out.  So, \n this  is  the  B6  Swift  laser \n engraver.  It  came  to  us  in  this  massive \n box  which  has  first  of  all  this  big \n piece.  This  is  the  base  and  power \n supply. \n and  then  this  smaller  piece  which  is  the \n laser \n itself.  I  am  a  little  overwhelmed  by  the \n possibilities  here.  In  theory,  this \n printer  allows  you  to  print  anything \n onto  pretty  much  anything.  So,  just  to \n give  you  an  idea,  yesterday  we  printed  a \n Squirtle  onto  this  dog  tag.  And  look  at \n it.  the  texturing,  the  detail,  not  to \n mention  just  how  mad  it  is  that  you  can \n actually  print  in  color  on  a  metal  using \n nothing  but  a  laser.  Like  there's  no  ink \n here.  It's  just  essentially  controlling \n the  temperature  and  therefore \n controlling  the  level  of  oxidation  in \n the  metal.  One  thing  that  would  be \n absolutely  crazy.  So,  we've  already \n printed  a  skin  for  a  phone,  but  what  if \n we  can  just  print  onto  a  phone?  So,  you \n line  the  phone  up.  This  is  so  freaking \n cool.  So,  we've  impleeded  the  Mr.  Who's \n the  Boss  logo,  and  it's  using  its \n measuring  laser  to  show  you  exactly \n where  that  logo  would  appear  on  the  body \n of  this  phone  before  you  confirm  it.  The \n software  as  well  is  super  advanced,  but \n it's  not  made  by  this  company.  It's  just \n general  use  laser  engraver  software.  So, \n 3  2  1  go.  Oh  my  god,  that  is  absolutely \n insane.  It's  like  top  five  coolest  tech \n products  I've  ever  interacted  with. \n This  is  really  impressive.  The  only \n thing  is  it  looks  like  something  about \n the  texture  on  the  back  of  this  phone  is \n kind  of  interfered  with  the  cutting \n process.  So,  it's  not  as  precise  as  it \n could  be.  I  want  to  do  it \n again.  This  is  the \n life.  And  that  actually  looks  wow. \n That's  like  a  factory  finish.  There's \n actually  nothing  on  the  surface  that \n would  even  imply  it's  been  tampered \n with.  But  just  to  laser  in  on  how \n absolutely  insane  this  thing  is.  This \n laser  is  so  powerful  that  it  can  also \n cut  metal.  So  let's  say  for  example  I \n wanted  to  make  a  necklace  for  pull  open \n a  photo  of  everyone's  favorite  cat. \n Chuck  it  into  the  computer  to  create  a \n depth  map  so  the  laser  knows  how  deep  to \n cut.  And  now  we  give  it  like  2  and  1/2 \n hours  and  see  what  it  comes  up \n with  until  you  end  up \n with  Oh  my \n god,  what  the  I  can't  actually  wrap  my \n head  around  how  insanely  detailed  this \n is.  My  eyes  aren't  good  enough.  It's  got \n to  like  a  microscopic  level  with  like \n every  hair  like  almost  a  bit  too  much \n detail.  That  right  there  has  just  rocked \n my  world.  This  is  one  of  those  products \n that  only  0.1%  of  the  population  should \n even  consider  buying,  but  its  output  is \n absolutely  extraordinary,  deserving,  I \n think,  of  Hall  of  Fame  status.  Now, \n obviously,  it's  not  going  to  fit  on  the \n Hall  of  Fame,  so  we'll  honor  it \n instead.  And  then  finally,  what's  the \n state  of  this  O  station?  Oh,  look.  Yeah, \n everything's  at  the  bottom.  So,  all  of \n these  batteries  are  now  completely \n recharged.  But  you  want  to  see  the \n coolest  bit?  This  tray  right  here,  in \n theory,  yes  it  does.  It  has  all  the \n batteries  that  are  either  unable  to  be \n recharged  or  just  straight  up  dead.  It's \n not  a  perfect  product  cuz  obviously  for \n a  lot  of  people,  the  era  of  AAA \n batteries  is  kind  of  nearing  its  close. \n And  also,  this  only  does  AAA  batteries. \n So,  if  you  wanted  to  be  fully  covered, \n you'd  need  like  10  different  versions  of \n this  one  machine.  But  still,  what  a \n genius  product  idea  that  actually  makes \n your  life  better.  So  the  question  is,  do \n I  back  Kickstarter?  I  would  say \n generally  no.  If  you're  just  backing \n anything  random  that  you  like  the  look \n of,  you've  got  a  50%  chance  of  the \n product  not  arriving.  And  then  even  if \n it  does,  there's  only  like  a  60%  chance \n that  it  actually  lives  up  to  the  lofty \n claims  that  the  companies  have  had  to \n make  to  have  their  product  have  a  good \n chance  of  success  on  Kickstarter.  Then \n if  you  are  going  for  companies  that  have \n a  great  track  record  then  it  can  be  an \n amazing  way  to  get  an  actually  sizable \n discount  and  the  product  before  anyone",
