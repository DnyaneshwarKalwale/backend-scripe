Well \n I  need  to  be  with  my  family  first  of \n all  with  my  children  mainly  and \n obviously \n uh  to  have  everything  that  a  family \n uh  can  have  to  be  well  okay  What \n is  education  security  good  schools \n obviously  a  good  home  I  stir  well  and  I \n feel  happy  because  a  part  of  my  life \n is  very  is  football  still  and  if  I'm \n well  football  Well  the  family \n is  happy  too  still  uh  we'll  talk  about  that \n still  well  it's  not  going  badly  it's  not \n bad  it's  growing  the  Saudi  Arabian  league \n you  are  the  pioneer  you  are  the  one  who \n arrives  you  are  the  one  who  breaks  the  market \n don't  say  it  you  say  it  everyone \n wants  to  follow  you  the  best  players \n want  to  follow  you  and  they  have  followed  you  of  the \n best  players  in  the  world  I  tell  you \n at  the  beginning  when  I  made  the \n decision  to  come  I  didn't  think  that  I  would  grow \n so  fast  or  and  there  would  be  such  a \n fast  change  but  I  knew  that  after  one  or  two \n years  2s  years  the  league  would  be  very  top  as  it \n is  at  the  moment  but  it  was  in  the \n first  year  So  things  went  very \n very  fast  and  and  obviously  I  was  the \n first  to  make  that  decision  and  the \n players  also  stars  of   Europe \n came  here  with  the  possibility  of \n obviously  having  better  contracts  to  have \n a  different  experience  to  help  him  with  the \n Saudi  project  and  and  and  and  our  the \n leader  of  the  country  AES  ENZ  well  of  the \n possibility  that  and  invested  in \n many  teams  so  that  the  league  could \n be  competitive  and  that's  why  we  are  having \n the  fruits  that  I  tell  you  that  the \n league  is  growing  very  fast  we  have \n in  Europe  a  different  vision  of  what \n the  level  of  Saudi  Arabia  really  is \n It's  that  people  don't  know  it's  normal \n when  people  don't  know  people  have  opinions  and \n talk  too  much  that's  normal \n sometimes  it  makes  me  feel  very  sorry  because  it's  a \n completely  different  reality  when \n people  talk  about  Arabia  when  people \n talk  for  example  about  the  United  States  for \n example  you  are  giving  an  example  or  about \n Turkey  the  league  is  worse  the  league  of  the  United \n States  Saudi  obviously  Obviously  obviously  but  since  it \n 's \n Saudi  Arabia  less  price  a  little  more  that's  what  I \n feel  but  I  also  know  that  those  people \n who  talk  don't  know  what  they  are  saying  that's  why  I \n give  the \n discount  because  only  those  who  play  here \n only  those  who  are  here  day  to \n day  play  in  the  league  see  the  teams  that  are  there  we \n have  to  give  value  to  there  we  have  the \n feeling  in  Europe  I  don't  say  Because  I   I \n come  to  Arabia  a  lot  and  and  and  I  come  to  your  house \n and  I've  gone  to  see  Deaser  matches  and  such. \n But  yes,  there  is  the  feeling  in  Europe \n that  the  Arabs  buy  everything  with \n money,  I  mean,  if  Nasser  wants \n Jalan  and  Mbappe  now,  they  pay  1000  million  and  he \n brings  him  in.  It  doesn't  work  like  that,  that  doesn't  work  like  that  and  it's  not \n going  to  work  like  that  in  my \n point  of  view.  Obviously,  the \n financial  power  here  is  much  greater  than  in \n Europe,  that's  a  reality,  but  what,  what's  up? \n How  do  you  sign?  How  many  foreigners \n can  play  in  a  squad?  Today, \n you  have  eight  foreigners  that  can  play \n plus  two  under-23s,  okay.  And  obviously, \n signings  are  limited  right  now, \n but  there's  always  the  possibility  of \n a  foreigner  leaving  and  another  foreigner  coming  in.  That's  why \n I  think  the  league  is \n going  to  have  a  natural  process  of \n evolution.  I  think  that  in  the  next  few \n years  they  could  open  another  vacancy,  another  vacancy, \n no  foreigners  or  10  foreigners \n exactly,  but  there's  another  warning.  If  you \n also  send  more  foreigners,  then  there  are \n fewer  places  for  the  Saudis,  the \n Arabs,  which  I  don't \n agree  with  much  either  because  I  think  the  Arabs \n are  very  good  players,  but  the \n education  as  we  have  Europe  is \n different  we  have  more  bases  than \n them  of  course  and  that  is  the  difference \n because  then  you  see  a  Saudi  has \n a  lot  of  potential  they  are  fast  they  are  thin  you \n know  but  that  is  that  initial  school  to \n worse  But  that  is  being  created  over  the  years  that \n infrastructure  is  being  created  we  are \n bringing  in  we  are  improving  the \n academies  we  are  bringing \n competent  people  from  Europe  to  be  able  to  help  and \n give  a  different  vision  as  it  is \n similar  to  Europe  and  little  by  little  it  is \n evolving  not  only  the  first \n teams  but  also  the  quarries  and \n increasingly  younger  In  the  end  it  was  the  first \n year  you  arrived  and  in  Arabia  they  signed \n people  of  35  or  36  years  old  now  they  are \n trying  to  get  players  who  may  not  be \n as \n important  but  younger  than  25  26 \n years  old  to  come  to  Arabia  with  a  good \n contract  but  to  improve  the  level \n too  that  is  not  what  is  happening  if  you \n look  more  or  less  the  last  15 \n signings  Maybe  they  are  all \n under  30  V  the  players  from \n Alnazar  We  count  Vento \n they  are  young  I  talk  about  for  example \n deal  savic  mitrovic  canceled  yes  yes  they  are  not  that \n old  of  course  they  are  all  below \n the   30  I'm  saying  that  the  teams  are  not \n that  old,  they  have  to  tijar, \n you  have  to  viid  that  are  also  young,  that \n is,  that  aspect  of  age  to \n retire  in  Arabs  is  over,  that  was \n the  past.  Okay,  not  now  because \n we  want  a  better,  more  competitive  league, \n a  league  of  the  future  because  as  you  know \n 2034  is  a  World  Cup  and  there  is  a  preparation \n up  to  there  and  that's  why  I  tell  you  the  league \n is  evolving  in \n a  normal,  fast  way  and  it  is  very, \n very  attractive  in  my  point  of  view,  it's \n true,  it's  true, \n not  everything  is  bought  with  money,  the \n government  manages  four  teams  that  it  gives \n some  bonuses,  bg  budget,  some  budgets. \n No,  no,  it's  not  to  say,  hey,  I  pay  1000  million \n to  bring  in  the  best  player  in \n Europe,  that's  not  like  that,  that's  not  like  that,  it's \n bringing  a  good  product  for  the  country  and \n everyone  benefits,  of  course,  it's  a  bit  like  that,  I \n mean,  because  at  the  League  level \n they  are  a  bit  fair  for  everyone,  ig  so  that \n all  the  teams  grow, \n exactly  the  same.  The  teams \n from  below  also  help,  for  example, \n Nacho's  team  also  helped \n with  good  players,  Nacho  Bang,  I  mean,  it's \n a  team  that   I  went  up  to  the  first  division  and  it  was \n a  team  that  beat  us  two  weeks \n ago,  it's  not  bad,  it's  not  a  very \n good  team,  competitive  and  it  has  very  high \n quality  players  and  that's  why  I  tell  you,  little  by \n little  the  league  is  growing  a  lot  at \n your  mental  level.  How  do  you  manage?  You'll  be \n 40.  Soon  you'll  be  40,  eh.  You \n 're  not  bad,  you  look  young.  How  do  you \n manage  to  maintain  that \n routine,  train,  train,  preparation, \n take  care  of  yourself,  it's  impossible.  Cris,  no,  no, \n that  you  always  feel  like  going  to  the  gym  and \n training.  At  39,  it's  not  a \n question  of  me  feeling  like  it,  it's  a \n commitment,  a  commitment,  a  passion,  and  I  still  have \n the  passion.  I  still \n wake  up  wanting  to  go,  train, \n and  play  games.  You  ask  me,  uh,  the  same  as \n before,  maybe  not  a  little \n less,  but  I  still  have  the  passion.  You \n understand,  the  passion  is  always  there,  it's \n always  here  and  it's  motivation.  I  like  to \n do  what  I  do,  I  do  it  with  passion, \n but  it's  hard,  obviously  it's  hard  for  me,  but  you  go, \n but  I  go,  that's  why  there's  the  commitment. \n The  commitment.  You  think  that  I  go  to  the \n gym  every  day  with  enthusiasm,  isn't  it \n true?  I  don't  go \n to  the  gym  every  day  with  enthusiasm,  I  go  because  there's  a  commitment. \n days  better  than  others  a  day  when  you \n 're  sadder  a  day  when  you're  more \n exhausted  a  day  when  you're  more  tired  it's \n commitment  and  I  have  that  there  are  many \n people  who  will  say  why  five  Champions  League \n and  Ballon  d'Ors  the  highest \n paid  athlete  in  history  the  one  with  the  most  goals \n nobody  nobody  is  going  to  take  you  more \n than  900  goals \n Why  to  make  history  it's  not  that  history \n history  It's  that  history  has  already  been \n written  it's  not  because  of  that  because  well  I'm \n going  to  be  very  honest  with  you  I  could  quit  my \n degree  today  and  not  regret  it  You're  welcome  You  know  I  think  it  would  be \n a  shame  because  I'm  still \n doing  very  well  I  mean  I'm  still \n making  a  difference  And  that  for  me \n left  me  a  little  bit  reluctant \n saying  [  __  ]  I  can \n continue  making  a  difference  One  more  year \n two  more  years  that's  why  I  tell  you  then  I \n reached  a  phase  in  my  life  where  I  live \n very  much  in  the  present  Now  I  don't  I  can't \n think  long  term  because  I \n don't  have  time  either  and  I  want  to  because  there  are \n several  things  that  happened  in  my  life  that \n make  me  think  like  that  that's  why  I  tell  you  is  to \n think  week  by  week  calmly \n make  a  good  schedule  prepare \n for  the  games  for  the \n training  and   Enjoying  football  every \n day  every  day  your  day  to  day  here  in \n Riyadh  in  Arabia  How  is  it  What  does \n Cristiano  Ronaldo  do  when  he  gets  up  getting  up \n I  like  to  have  breakfast  with  with  my \n wife  with  Gio  Chatting  have \n coffee  for \n training  be  there  at  training  do \n my  things  train  well  go  home  to  eat  I  have  to \n go  pick  up  my  children  from \n school  you  go  pick  up  the  children  from \n school  from  time  to  time  with  her  he  has \n physical  activity  I  accompany  Mateo  to  the \n same  own  alana  and  Eva  accompanying  the \n family  following  resting \n recovering  you  go  out  to  dinner  out  from  time \n to  time  I  go  out  to  dinner  very \n occasionally  I  ask  you  as  if  I  didn't \n know  But  well  it's  fine  Things  are \n normal  I  try  to  do  We  go  out  to  dinner \n many  times  we  go  out  to  dinner  but \n Cris  I've  seen  man  we've  been  we've \n spent  almost  every  summer  together  Or \n many  summers  together  we've  been  to \n places  in  the  Red  sea  we've  been  to \n Dubai  we've  been  to  I  don't  know  it  doesn't  scare  you \n man  you're  the  person  with  the  most  followers \n in  the  world  not  an  athlete \n in  the  world  there's  no  place  in  the \n world  where  you  can  go  and   They  don't \n know  you,  it  doesn't  bother  you,  you  don't  know  why \n Because  there  comes  a  time  in  my  life  when  I \n say  this  because  I'm  going  to  think  about  something  that \n I  can't  do  or  think  about  something  that \n I  can  do  and  enjoy,  there's \n the  difference,  obviously  there  are  things  that  I  would \n like  to  do  but  it's  that  I  don't  think \n about  that  anymore.  I  know  what  I  am,  I  know  what \n demand  is,  I  try  to  enjoy  what  I \n can  do.  I  mean,  no,  we  always \n when  we  hear  criticism  we  forget \n that  there  are  100  positives  and  there  is  one  criticism \n and  we  go  against  the  criticism  that  it  should \n be  the  other  way  around,  valuing  the  good.  I  am \n like  that  in  my  life,  which  is  valuing  what \n I  can  do,  what  makes  me  happy  and \n being  with  who  makes  me  happy,  everything \n else  is  normal,  me,  it's  not  my  fault  for \n being  the  most  famous,  for  being  the  most  followed, \n followed,  these  are  parts  of  life,  people  know \n me,  people  like  Christian, \n people  who  don't  like  them  but  they \n follow  them  like  that,  they  want  to  know,  it's  part  of  life, \n I'm  used  to  it,  no,  it  doesn't  make \n any  difference  to  me,  but  wouldn't  you  like  to \n say  for  one  day,  wow,  I  don't  want \n anyone  to  know  me,  no,  because  don't  think  about \n that,  it's  not  true.  I  understand  your  question  and   I \n could  say  obviously  I  would  like  to  go  out \n here  and  stop  there  at  a  bar,  sit  down  and  watch \n the  cars  going  by  and  well  nothing \n bothers  me  anymore  But  why  would  I  think  something \n that  is  not  possible  is  that  it  no  longer  exists  that  is \n a  dream  maybe  it  can  happen \n but  it's  that  no  it  doesn't  happen  that  you  know  I  do \n other  things  that  make  me  happy  why  would \n I  do  that  if  I  know  that  people  are \n going  to  bother  me  no  but  I  say  that  there  are  eh  eh \n many  players  that  with  one  or  players \n or  or  or  very  well  known  people  that  with  a \n fly  on  TV  that  the  people  that \n players  that  are  not  so  well  known \n but  that  quickly  get  to  their \n heads  that  fame  how  about  And  you  have  been \n since  you  were  18 \n practically  unable  to  leave  the  house \n without  people  knowing  you  and  what  am  I  going  to  do?  I'm  going \n to  be  happy,  I'm  going  to  cry,  I'm  going  to \n complain  I  can't  do  it  I  am  very \n happy  with  the  things  that  I  have  with  the \n things  that  I  do  I  am  with  the  people  that  I \n love  playing  interviews  with  the  people  that  I \n love  you  know  it's  a  little  it's  a  little \n like  that  you  know \n No  I  see  what  is  possible  to  do  not  what  is  not \n possible  to  do  there  is  something  left  of \n that  9  year  old  boy  in  Madeira   that  I  dreamed \n of  being  a  player  you  stop  to  think  wow \n man  look  at  what  I've  achieved  and \n many \n times  you  have  to  go  through  something  for  you  to  think  about  the \n good  things  that  life  gave  you  in  all \n aspects  football  life  your  family  and \n sometimes  I  reflect  a  little  on  that  and  I  say \n why  do  I  get  so  angry  about  this  with \n this  but  it's  part  of  me  too  I \n think  that  I'm  such  a \n competitive  person  that  many  times  I  forget  to \n think  about  what  I  have  what  I \n achieved  because  that  gives  me \n motivation  to  want  to  do  more  and  better \n year  after  year  I  think  that's  the  difference \n with  the  others  because  maybe  if  someone  else \n had  my  position  with \n all  the  conditions  that  I  have  I  would  have  already  left \n football  10  years  ago  Of  course  but  I \n still  have  that  passion  that's  why  I  tell  you \n many  times  I  am  different  from  the \n others  I  tell  you  not  only  because  of  numbers \n because  in  all  aspects  numbers  of \n football  and  numbers  from  abroad  it's  that  it's  the \n same  it's  the  same  I'm  different  Period \n You  notice  that  no  Of  course  I  notice  it  I \n notice  it  and  and  and  and  and  how  I  said  as  we  say  I  say \n Always  a  pharmacist's  expression  what  I \n gave   Literature,  literature  doesn't \n lie,  numbers  don't  lie,  that's  why  I  do \n n't  have  to \n boast,  I  mean,  or  I  boast  about  something \n that's  true,  there's  no  need  to  be \n ashamed  to  face  the  facts.  You  know,  you \n 've  changed  football,  not  only  in \n terms  of  numbers,  but  you've  changed  the \n preparation  before  a  match,  before \n a  training  session,  the  recovery.  I  mean, \n the  reality  is  that,  uh,  millions  of  children \n and  young  people  look  up  to  you \n because  when  it  was  said  that \n players  couldn't  go  to  the  gym, \n you  were  the  first  to  go  to  the  gym \n and  the  last  to  leave.  Now  you  have  a \n lot  of.  Well,  there's  a  room \n down  there,  it's  got  a  lot  of  machines.  You  like  to \n study,  you  like  to  read.  Are  you  aware \n of  the  fact  that  you've  changed  football,  the \n preparation?  We're  very  aware  of  many \n things,  and  one  of  those  is \n not  only  at  the  recovery  level,  and  I'm \n telling  you,  we're  going  to  launch  a  brand  with \n recovery  products,  which  is  something \n that  people  are  going  to  like  a  lot  because \n I  think  that  the  more  hours  you  put  in \n training,  you  have  to  put  in  the  same  number  of \n hours  to  recover.  What  I  was \n explaining  to  you  before  is,  if  you  train  3  hours  a \n day,  try  to  recover  3  hours  a  day,  that's \n my  philosophy.   life  and  my  vision  more  or \n less  does  not  have  to  be  the  same  and  I  know  that  I \n changed  many  many  footballers \n the  idea  of ​​​​ see  football  but  I  have \n many  things  that  I  think  in  my  head,  I \n am  not  influenced,  I  have  had  22  23 \n 24  25  coaches  in  my  career \n and  I  have  a  way  of  seeing  football  and \n life  mainly  of \n maximum  demand,  being  Fit, \n recovering,  very  different  from  the  others,  I \n already  know  where  you  are  going  to  get  to  and  I  will  give  you  my \n point  of  view.  As  there  is  now  the  debate \n that  the  players  are  complaining \n a  lot  about  the  amount  of  games  that  the \n national  team  is  watching,  it  is  that  there  are  many \n games,  three  games  in  three  days,  it  is \n very  difficult,  the  truth  is  that  it  is  very \n difficult.  Yes,  but  you  do  not  get  injured  anymore,  that  is \n why  here  in  Arabia  you  play  every  TR  days \n that  people  say  no,  maybe  I  play \n more  in  Arabia  than  in  Europe  and  the \n numbers  say  so,  we  were  wrong  for  two  years, \n I  have  done  it,  for  example,  I  was  now  in  the \n national  team,  I  was  the  player  in  the  national  team  who \n had  the  most  minutes  in  the  Eurocup,  I  was  the \n player  in  the  Eurocup  for  the  Portugal  national  team \n who  had  the  most  minutes  and \n why  don't  you  get  injured?  Why  are \n all  the  players   world  level \n less  Christian  with  39  years  already  but  that \n also  you  have  a  luck  factor  and  a \n preparation  factor  it  was  not  luck  luck \n not  muscularly  how  many  times  have  you  been \n injured  in  your  life  but  already \n but  two  breaks  that  there  has  been  a  break  that  is \n two  do  you  remember  I  no  longer  remember \n thank  God  but  there  is  a \n factor  to  minimize  the  risk  of  having \n an  injury  there  is  a  luck  factor  for  everything \n in  life  but  luck  is  I  try  I  try  to \n try  to  do  the \n possible  mechanisms  to  not  have  that  lack  of \n luck  let's  say  like  that  and  eh  I  believe  I  believe \n that  the  number  of \n games  can  be  an  important  factor \n that  there  are  more  injuries  I  think  that  yes  it \n has  a  correlation  my  opinion  Yes  because  you  have \n less  preparation  you  have  less  the \n muscle  is  less  recovered  the \n joints  the  bones  it  is  normal  to  be \n in  tension  you  have  a  brutal  wear  and  tear \n it  is  difficult  but  I  try  to  find  my \n \n recovery  mechanisms  to  be  able  to  be  well  not \n have  problems  and  give  my  best  for  the \n game  which  is  the  most  important  thing  my \n point  of  view  as  a \n footballer  as  one  of  the  players  with  the \n most  games  in  the  history  of  football \n also  the  one  who  I  believe  the  most  eh  or  the  one  who \n has  the  most  that  data  I  do  not  have  but \n I  believe  I  believe  that  yes  I   I  was  watching  the  other \n day  but  I'm  there  some  I  gave  the  third \n some  I  gave  the  first  but  it  doesn't  matter \n I'm  there  not  a  goalkeeper  not  a  goalkeeper  It's \n true  the  way  I  see  it  Cristiano  the \n way  to  minimize  injuries  by  the \n amount  of  games  train  less  when  you \n say  train  less  is \n specific  training  worth  for  each  player  the \n center  backs  the  midfielders  is  to  train  less  less \n physical  body  wear  so \n you  can  perform  and  with  less  risk  of  damage \n in  the  games  that's  my  point  of  view  the \n \n coaches  understand  it  I  do  my  management  Ed  I \n do  my \n management  there  are  many  coaches  who \n understand  management  and  are  very  smart  I \n can  say  I  don't  want  to  freeze  names \n but  for  example  Mr  Piol  and  Mr  Luis \n Castro  who  was  with  me  at  the  club \n were  very  intelligent  in  that  aspect  and  they \n knew  I  can't  do  my  recovery \n the  same  with  a  20  year  old  kid  of  course  you \n know  maybe  I  need  a  clearer  day \n you  understand  and  those  differences  that \n people  have  to  understand  the  media  there  is \n wear  and  tear  in  a  game  you \n can't  put  that  kid  train  two \n days  48  hours  make  the  field  maybe \n rest  for  him  specific  work \n I  don't  know  a  specific \n gym  work  of  stretching  of  him  It's  going  to  be \n better  is  that  in  the  end  he  comes  in  playing  every \n Three  days  is  impossible,  you  don't  need  a \n physical  background,  do  background,  do  cardio,  you  already \n have  it,  because  the  game  gives  it  to  you, \n the  game  gives  you  everything,  the  most  difficult  thing \n about  football  is  playing  a \n football  game  because  you  wear  yourself  out,  you  kill  yourself,  you \n give  everything,  sprints,  high \n intensity  cardio,  everything,  because  you're  going  to \n train  after  a  day  or  two, \n running  in  it.  I'm  talking  about  a  way \n that  is  now   to  the  football  every  TR  every \n three  tenos  a  week  the  programming  has  to  be \n different  you  understand  but  I \n think  there  should  be  that  change  everyone \n helps  each  other  everyone  because  I  think  it's \n the  only  way  I  don't  see  any  other \n way  because  it's  not  going  to  stop  because  there  are \n several  interests  as  you  know  and \n football  is  like  that  television  is  like  that  more  and  more \n business  more  sponsors  more \n money  more  I  like  to  compete \n I  like  to  play  yes  yes  it's  to  play \n three  in  three  days  or  four  in  four  I \n play  but  I  can't  be  48  hours \n later  on  a  field  making \n sudden  movements  I  can't  because  I  can  do  it  and  I \n 'm  prepared  to  do  it  Yes  but  the \n benefit  for  the  game  past  24 \n hours  I  think  it's  going  to  be  better  Of  course \n if  not  knowing  how  to  manage  the \n players  knowing  how  to  manage  and  the \n rest  time  but  there  are  other  coaches \n that  don't  give  you  that  possibility  If  you  tell \n a  coach  Maybe  the \n coaches  that  on  the  second  day  you're \n tired  don't  go  to  the  field  he'll  say \n coach  then  he  doesn't  put  you  in  the  team  there \n are  several  sides  there  are  players  that \n are  afraid  to  talk  to  say  how  they  are \n I  saw  players  that  I  played  that  on  the \n second  day  are  dead   tiredness  tiredness \n because  after  48  hours  is \n where  the  total  fatigue  of  the  body \n normally  comes,  I  am  better  on  the  second  day \n than  the  pre-match  second  like  the  second \n day  for  example  I  play  today  tomorrow \n normally  aa  you  are  not  so  tired  but \n the  second  day  4  hours  later  when  you \n get  a  drop  of  tiredness  you  understand, \n normally  there  but  0%  of  the  games  I \n know  my  teammates  who  are  tired  on  the  second \n day  and  the  field  and  you  know  I  know  what  they \n will  say  they  will  think  that  I  stay  in \n the  gym  to  not  train  anymore  but  you \n can  do  that  because  nobody  is  going  to \n doubt  you,  your  sacrifice,  your \n physical  capacity  but  I  think  that  there \n should  be  a  better  approach  with  the \n players  to  give  that  possibility  of  seeing \n because  nowadays  there  are  data  that \n show  you  for  example  the  cpk  which  is  a \n muscular  damage  cpk  is  a  test  they \n do  the  blood  is  worth  it  to  see  your \n muscular  damage  okay  and  we  have  in  the  club  a \n person  who  shows  your  muscular  damage \n 48  hours  24  hours  and  48  hours  and  tells  you \n this  one  is  screwed  It  is  not  that  he  is  screwed  He \n is  still  in  a  process  of \n inflammation  he  is  recovering  he  cannot \n go  into  the  field   Doing  Box  to  Box  is \n exa,  you  can't  do  it  but  a  little  now, \n just  for \n or  better  for  your  head,  but  no,  I'm \n telling  you  not  to  train,  for  example,  being  there  for \n an  hour  and  a  half  on  the  field,  doing  it  for \n me,  you  don't  see  anything,  he's  a  kid,  maybe \n 18,  20  years  old,  21,  who  still  needs  to  know  his \n body,  but  I'm  saying  those  who  play \n more,  of  course,  three  a  day  at  a  time,  and  you \n have  said  that  you  have \n mechanisms  a  day  to  get  injured.  How  many  hours  are  those \n mechanisms?  How  many  hours  do  you  spend \n during  the  day  thinking  about  football? \n Ed,  my,  I  can't  not  think  about \n football,  but  my  subconscious  goes  for \n football.  What  I  mean  is,  for \n me,  recovery  is  as  important \n as  training.  For  example,  if  I \n train  today  and  it's  2  hours  of  training  plus  the \n gym  plus  the  field,  I  don't  know  what,  and  I  come \n home  and  I  don't  know,  I  do  a  pad  with \n friends,  if  I  wear  myself  out  for  3  hours,  I  have  to \n do  3  hours  of  recovery \n during  the  day,  but  that's  already  automatic. \n For  example,  you're  going  to  leave \n my  house,  my  wife  and  my  children  are  going  to  arrive,  I \n 'm  going  to  have  dinner  and  I'm  going  to  watch  maybe  a \n game  here.   with  Ava's  boots  which  is \n my  company  now  for \n recovery,  you  know  that  adds  up.  I  mean, \n you  watch  TV  at  the  same  time  you're \n recovering  second,  second  half  of  the \n game,  the  kids  go,  put  the  kids  to \n bed  and  such,  I  go  down  with  Gio,  we  watch  a \n Netflix  movie,  I'll  do  another  machine.  I \n mean,  it  doesn't  cost  anything.  Yes,  but \n you're  always  connected  to  the  machines.  I'm \n telling  you,  I  mean, \n people  don't  know,  Cris,  but  we  come.  It's \n true,  you  think  it's  funny,  but  you're \n saying,  why  do  the \n machines  go  to  the  hospital?  No,  no,  no,  obviously  not  and  let's \n hope  not,  but  but  you're  here, \n man,  we've  come  from  dinner  or  we've  come  from \n the  beach  or  whatever,  and  you're  always \n walking,  but  people,  you  know,  it  makes  me \n angry,  man,  because  I  say,  okay, \n people  know  that  you're \n great,  that  you  take  care  of  yourself,  that  you  go  to  the \n gym,  but  they  don't  know  how  crazy  you \n are,  to  the  level  of  [  __  ],  why  am  I  going  to  be \n here  for  15  minutes  watching  a \n documentary  when  I  could  put  on  the  red  light,  when  I  could \n put  on  Aba's  boots, \n when  they  say  that  women  can \n do  two  things  at  once  or  three, \n no,  I  do, \n I  can  watch  TV,  to  a \n machine,  but \n always   but  it's  really  cool  dude  it's  really  cool \n you  know  people  think  that  you  train  that  you \n 're  really  strong  but  they  don't  know  that  from  the  moment \n you  get  up  until  you  Well  before  I \n think  that  smart  people  people  who  are \n into  fitness  people  who  understand  that \n athletes  understand  I  mean  it  can't  be \n just  you  have  to  do  something  more  than  the \n others  you  know  but  the  truth  is  that  that \n 's  also  my  subconscious  that  does  it \n sometimes  it's  autopilot  I  think  about \n doing  it  it's  that  it  comes  out  clear  you \n understand  I'm  Here  I  go  watch \n television  automatically  go  to  the \n couch  I  give  Here  I  go  to  the  left  like \n some  sport  boots  I  go  over  there  I  put  it  on  and \n watch  television  you  understand  it's  a  little \n autopilot  no  no  it's  hard  for  me  to \n do  it  and  at  the  level  of  diet \n food  I  don't  diet  because  the \n word  diet  for  me  the  word  diet \n comes  from  Latin  it  means  routine  And \n for  me  to  have  good  routines  okay  I \n have  good  routines  you  know  Ho \n have  a  hamburger  with  potatoes  It's  not  a \n problem  but  I  know  that  I'm  not  going  to \n Better  have  you  piz  said  maybe  you  see  But  it's  not  a  problem  it \n 's  the  routine  okay  You  know \n now  at  my  age  if  I  want  to  continue \n playing  soccer  I  implement  a  theory \n that  is  when  you  are  young  you  can  do \n 50 \n 50%  you  do  you  have  energy  you  can  do \n stupid  things  and  50%  eat  train  well  but \n eating  50%  stupid  things \n is \n sea  But  it's  hard  for  you  to  eat  it's  hard  for  you  to \n skip  skipping  the  diet  when  I  talk  about \n skipping  the  diet  it's  eating  pizzas \n eating  sweets  it's  not  hard  for  me  you  know  why \n Because  I  do  things  right  already  bu \n people  do  there's  a  factor  there's  a \n psychological  factor  that  helps  you  too \n say \n let  me  be  free  a  little  let  me  be \n calm  to  eat  something  that  I  like \n why  are  you  talking  maybe  once  a \n week  eating  garbage  bad  food \n that  isn't  bad  food  either  it's \n eating  a  sweet  a  dessert  no  problem  now \n Now  I'm  not  going  to  eat  every  day \n Well  the  next  day  you  burn  it  off  I  burn  it  off \n through  normal  life  and  the  body  is  sa  or \n that  same  night  or  that  same  night \n later  when  we  go  to  play \n father  it  could  be  too  but  it's  just  that  do \n n't  think  about  that  you  know  no  [  __  ]  if \n one  of  my  children  comes  with  one  with \n cookies  and  such  dad  takes  a  cookie  don't \n be  the  father  the  edge  Oh \n \n I  don't  want  you \n know  it's  jí  It's  that  for  me  it's  the  key  to  everything  it's  that  I  was  remembering  in  in  not  in  in   Red  do  you  remember  about  the  padel  game  you \n went  to  do,  a  Japanese  game  and  we  went?  Ah, \n some  desserts  and  there  we  ate  desserts,  I  don't  know \n how  many,  we  go  home  and  at  1  in  the \n morning  Christian  says,  boy,  it's  a \n padel  game  do  you  remember,  vacation,  that's \n vacation,  you  go  play  padel  for  two  hours \n and  that's  the  beauty  of  it.  Yes,  1000  calories, \n eh,  when  you  don't  have  a  vacation,  you  have  to  do \n everything,  you  have  to  do \n everything,  you  have  to  disconnect  with  900,  you \n 're  not  dead,  with  900  and  a  lot  of \n goals,  you're  a  little  tired  of  people \n repeating  the  1000  goals  thing,  man,  the \n truth  is,  not  tired,  but  a  little. \n Ah,  how \n can  I  put  a  word  in, \n people  are  a  little  heavy  with  the  1 \n goals.  I  know  that  I'm  also  guilty, \n but  it  seems  that  I'm \n devaluing  what  I'm  doing,  for \n example,  this  year  I'm  scoring  goals, \n a  lot  of  goals,  I'm  scoring  beautiful  goals \n and  I'm  doing  well,  and  people  aren't \n valuing  my  moment,  my  goals,  you  know,  you \n 're  Ah,  85  missing,  missing,  but  I  don't,  but  I  think  that,  but  I \n think  they  do  it \n for,  for,  for  how   they  idolize  you  how  they  love  you  I \n mean  it  could  be  they  want  you  to \n reach  1000  goals  so  much  they're \n doing  the  Countdown  but  I  don't \n like  it  I  don't  like  it  things  have  to \n happen  in  a  natural  way  it's  that  scoring \n 920  goals  925  30  It's  that  the  best  in \n history  is  me  period  it's  that  there  is  no \n the  best  in  history  is  you \n scoring  goals  the  numbers  say  it \n numbers  the  numbers  that's  why  I'm  not  going  to \n tell  you  here  Oh  you  have  to  get  there  get  there \n [  __  ]  great  do  you  think  it's  an  objective  do  you  think  you're  going  to \n get  there  I  don't  know  but  I'm  telling  you \n sincerely  man  You  have  to  get  there  I'm \n a  pain  I'm  a  pain  You  have  to \n get  there  man  it's  but  it's  what  I'm  telling  you  I  can't  I  don't  I  don't \n think  long  term  I'm  telling  you  I'm \n telling  you  the  truth  I  swear \n on  my  children  I  think  in  the  moment  in \n the  present  it's  that  I  don't  know  tomorrow  what's \n going  to  happen  if  I  wake  up \n unmotivated  I  don't  want  to  play  anymore  it's  that  I  don't  I  don't \n know  living  in  the  moment  is  more \n beautiful  than  thinking  long  term  believe  me \n in  football  mainly  because  that's  where \n you're  going  to  be  better  you're  going  to   You'll \n better  dedicate  it,  you'll  better  value  the  moment,  the \n football  itself,  the  competitions,  what  to \n think  about.  Ah,  the  World  Cup  isn't  coming  up  in  a \n year  and  a  half,  [  __  ],  but  there's  a  year  and  a \n half  left,  you  have  so  many  things  to  do,  so  many \n beautiful  chapters  that  are  going  to  happen \n in  your  life,  matches,  it's  impossible.  Cris, \n even  if  it's  for  a  moment,  I  do \n n't  think  about  the  World  Cup,  I  don't  think  I'll  get  there,  I  won't  get  there,  I  don't  think,  I  don't  think  I'm  going  to  get  there,  I \n swear \n on  my  children  that  I  don't  think  I'll  get  there  like  a \n [  __  ]  great,  I  don't  know  where  I'm  going,  it's  that  not  even  for \n now,  for  now  it  seems  that  everything  is  going  towards  you \n getting  there,  [  __  ],  you're  39  years  old, \n anything  goes,  indicate  if  you  ask  me,  would  you \n like  Sas,  I  don't  know  how  many  goals  you  would \n like?  Yes,  but  I'm  not \n obsessed  with  that  either.  Honestly,  but \n I'm  telling  you,  I'm  not  saying  it  because  of  the  interview \n because  I'm  telling  you,  no,  I'm  not.  But  I'm  telling  you, \n you  really  know  me.  I'm  sincere, \n because  there  are  people  who  like  Cristiano  and  don't \n like  him,  it's  just  that  I  don't  care,  you  reach  a \n point  in  your  life  where  no  matter  how  well  you \n do,  or  or  or  or  you  don't  do  it, \n people  are  going  to  talk  about  you,  they're  going  to  criticize,  they're  going \n to  make  up  stories,  they're  going  to  make  up \n things,  what  are  you  going  to  do?   do  there  are  many \n stories  made  up  daily  daily \n daily  it's  incredible  but  And  what  what's  going  to \n change  in  my  life  You  know  an  opinion  of \n a  journalist  or  or  of  a  person \n who  works  in  a  magazine  you  know  It's  not \n that  I  can't  change  my  way  of  seeing \n and  with  maturity  with  experience  you  start  to \n sit  more  and  more  And  you  start  to \n see  that  no  that  you  don't \n give  interest  to  those  people  because  it's  not \n worth  it  you  have  changed  your  way  of \n accepting  criticism  or  stop \n reading  social  networks \n news  now  I  open  something  and  I  read  that \n Christian  I  don't  know  what  it  is  that  it  doesn't \n even  enter  my  my  brain  doesn't  enter  me \n because  I  know  that  there  are  people  who  don't  know  me \n people  who  have  never  been  with  me  people \n who  are  envious  because  being  in  my \n position  generates  a  lot  of  envy  You \n know  [  __  ]  and  and  I  have  other  aspects  that  are \n even  worse  for  what  envy  do  you \n understand  you  know  what  I  mean  yes  yes \n and  it's  part  you  know  is  part  of  of \n my  life  of  my  story  it's  always  going  to  be  like  this  it \n will  always  be  like  this  and  I  have  to \n live  with  the  people  that  love  the  fans \n that  love  me  the  people  my  family  my \n friends  you  know  and  and  it's  like  that  has  there  been  any \n news  that  you've  said  have  well  many \n you  I'm  going   to  say  some  news  that  have \n crossed  Oh  That's  why  there  are  that's  why  there  are \n lawyers  That's  why  there  are  processes  to  do  that's  why  there  are \n stories  that  are \n more  serious  than  others  you  understand  but  I \n have  a  team  of  lawyers  and \n when  there  are  serious  things  then  you  have  to \n report  them  because  not  everything  is  worth  it  you \n understand  But  even  so  I  try  to  take  as \n much  of  my  energy  as  possible  because  I \n have  competent  people  who  help  me \n take  that  pressure  off  too  and  when  you \n lose  a  game  it's  the  same  Christian \n at  20  years  old  the  one  who  gets  home  or  with  the \n load  that  you  have  Now  I  believe  that  at  a \n competitive  level  And  that \n anger  of  losing  not  accepting  it  is \n less  what  I  say  I  accept  more  but  at  the \n same  time  it's  there  I  think  it  didn't  change  you  do \n n't  accept  more  when  you  get  home \n when  it  gets  home  on  the  field  not  on  the \n field  no  because  on  the  field  you  are  the \n most  stung  guy  in  the  world  I  say  like  that  everything \n that  happens  on  the  field  has  to  be  given  on \n the  field  How  does  the  expression  What's \n happen  in  Vegas  in  Vegas  what  happens  on  the \n field  stays  on  the  field  I  can't \n get  there  with  my  problems  from  the \n football  field  and  get  home  inter  I  can't  it \n 's  not  fair  of  course  you  understand  I  try   to  detach \n very  difficult  Yes  it  is  very  difficult  but  little \n by  little  with  time  you  learn  to \n deal  with  certain  circumstances  in \n life  and  to  love  as  a  person  as  a \n human  being  and  and  capable  of  doing  it  but  in  the \n beginning  it  was  very  difficult  I  tell  you \n clearly  I  remember  myself  in  Madrid \n for  example  in  Madrid  and  for  example  if  I \n missed  a  chance  or  I  missed  a \n penalty  I  would  lock  myself  in  my  room  you  know \n angry  with  myself  as  you  know  I  didn't \n allow  myself  to  fail  and  I  talked  to  myself  you \n only  know  with  the  lights  off  I  mean  I  was \n sick  how  How  did  you  talk  with  the \n lights  off  no  no  it  was  hard  for  me  without  dinner  and \n saying  why  did  you  throw  to  the  right  you  didn't \n go  in  to  the  left  and  you're  stupid  and \n like  talking  to  myself  like  doing  your \n visualization  of  of  in  a  bad  mood  you  know \n but  I  am  like  that  and  I  have  learned  a  lot  from  there  I  do \n not  regret  being  like  this  because  if  I \n am  still  like  this  at  this  age  and  I  continue \n doing  what  I  am  doing  because \n that  past  that  I  had  I  still  have \n that  competitive  level  that  you  have \n in  everything  I  know  you  and  We  have  played  a \n thousand  sports,  on  vacation,  to  cards,  to \n whatever  you  are  one  of  the  best  guys,  the \n most  bitter  guy  I  know   I  swear  it \n really  is  that  level  of  competitiveness  I \n had  it  comes  standard  I  mean  with  cco \n or  I  know  years  you  were  so  competitive  I \n was  always  very  pitiful  since  I  was  young  I \n hated  losing  and  I \n cried  and  now  I  don't  accept  it  anymore  go \n home  and  cry  if  you  lost  even  my \n neighbors  would  call  me  he  would  call  me  he  cried  who \n was  me  ap  pelido  there  was  a  man \n who  how  are  you  crying  yes  yes  because \n when  I  lost  I  cried  with  rage  rage \n but  it's  my  way  it  was  my  way  of  being  maybe  it \n was  my  education  growing  up  in \n that  but  little  by  little  I  was  assimilating  I  was \n improving  yeah  with  that  bad  temper  of \n losing  being  on  the  field  and  doing  what \n I  do  that  I'm  not  perfect  I  admit  that  from \n time  to  time  I  exaggerate  but  it's  my  way \n of  being  I'm  not  going  to  change  You  know  why  in \n the  end  yes  My  motivation  remains  the \n same  it's  because  I  have  those \n residues  already  from  the  bad  Osa  of  the  past \n too  and  and  I  hope  to  continue  like  this  but  in \n a  more  balanced  way  also  with \n my  age  with  my  children  sometimes  I  come \n home  and  my  daughters  reproach  me  dad  and \n why  did  you  do  that  and  I  don't  know  what  in  the \n game   match  of  the  match  why \n were  you  talking  to  the  referee  like  that  you \n know  and  as  if  saying  you  give  a  bad  image  don't \n protest  don't  get  angry  No  of  course  they \n tell  me  that  and  why  were  you  like  that \n raising  your  arms  and  like  I  got \n angry  and  I  was  like  well  dad  it's  like  that  it's  like  that  and  that's  it  Can \n you  imagine  the  day  you  leave \n football  I  can't  imagine  it  will  be  difficult  obviously \n what  he  has  always  told  you  was  my  passion  and \n football  is  my  passion  but  I  am \n preparing  You  know  I  am  preparing \n I  am  preparing  my  future  since  I  was \n 27  28  years  old  eh  How  with  several \n companies  ah  things  that  can  motivate  me  things  that \n I  can  contribute  something  things  that  I \n can  that  I  can  help \n society  young  people  eh  Not  only  at  the  level \n of \n obviously \n hotels  clinics \n recovery  companies  what  comes \n next  but  doing  things  that  I  can \n spend  time  in  also  that  I  have  fun  as \n well  and  learning  other  sectors  that  I \n think  I  can  contribute  something  but  it  will  be \n difficult  obviously  it  will  be  difficult  on  a  mental  level \n  \n eh  very  difficult  I  tell  you  no  I  don't \n think  but  I  know  that  it  is  close  I  mean \n but  I  think  that  I  will  be  minimally \n prepared  Yes  but  mentally  for \n example  you  know  why  you  know  what  I \n believe  I   I  talk  to  Pepe  who  left  a \n short  time  ago  and  I  ask  him,  I  talk  to \n him  many  times  and  I  ask  him  how  he  is \n and  Cris  better  than  ever \n because  I  think  that  one  of  the  tests, \n no,  one  of  the  tests,  one  of  the  things  that \n can  calm  you  and  accept  the \n best  thing  is  to  prolong  your  career  as  much  as  you  can \n because  when  you  stop  saying \n no,  you  give  more  of  the  maximum  of  me.  That's  why  you  have  to \n be  proud  of  yourself,  do  you \n understand  what  I  mean?  I  know  how  to \n leave  at  40,  41,  42,  he  says,  [  __  ],  42 ​​ is \n too  old,  that's  it,  I  should  already  be,  normal  for \n players  33,  34  and  this  is  already  a \n gift,  in  my  opinion,  it's  a  gift  and \n doing  what  I'm  doing,  you  understand,  that's  why  I'm \n telling  you.  I'm  prolonging  it,  I'm \n making  an  effort,  I'm \n dedicating  myself,  many  times  I'm  a \n fan,  a  fan  of  my  job,  a  fan,  I  set  myself  as  a \n reference,  I'm  not  a  reference,  it's  like  I \n dedicate  myself  too  much  to  this  and  sometimes  I  don't  live  much  longer, \n for  example.  Now  it  was \n shopping  with  the  children.  I  don't \n praise  it  either,  but  other  places  to  live \n accompanying  my  children,  another  time  I  was \n in  the  national  team,  I  was  in  the  national  team  and \n at   Naca  birthday  I  wasn't  there  anymore  it's  getting  harder  and  harder  for  me \n but  I'm \n prolonging  it  prolonging  it  until  the \n moment  of  saying  no  more  and  now  I'm  going  to \n enjoy  being  with  my  family  to  be  there \n in  the  most  important  moments  and  they \n understand  why  I  tell  them  dad  I'm  still \n playing  but  it's  harder  for  me  yes  But  there  are \n people  who  retire  and  people  who \n retire  I \n mean  Cross  retired  and  could  have \n played  he's  a  much  more  option  Nadal \n retired  recently  and  Rafa  said  the \n body's  not  up  to  it  anymore  my  body's  not  up  to  it  that's  it  that's  it \n you  You  will  make  sure \n your  body  doesn't  give  any  more  I  don't  want  to  reach \n that  moment  to  say  it  but  the  body  is \n giving  you  signals  too  but  there  comes  a \n moment  when  it's  metabolically  It's \n normal  we're  getting \n older  all  of  society  and  for  an \n elite  sport  age  is  a \n very  important  factor  I  know  I  don't \n show  that  I'm  almost  40  I  took  care  of  myself  and  I  also  treated \n my  body  well  the  last  15 \n years  that  it's  giving  me  now  what  I \n gave  it  before  is  that  more  goals  from \n 30  onwards  you  have  scored  more  goals  than  before  I \n think  I  still   same  there  same  the \n same  if  I  went  a  little  bit  that's  why  I \n tell  you  it's  a  d  for  me  it's  about  making  the \n most  of  it  enjoying  living  the  moment  like  I \n told  you  before  and  I'll  repeat \n enjoying  the  moment  but  the  goal  creates \n addiction  scoring  a  goal  is  addictive \n Obviously  obviously  yes  it's  not  for  you  it's  the \n best  feeling  in  the  world  it's  the  best \n feeling  in  the  world  and  the  most  difficult  thing  in \n football  is  scoring  goals  and  not  suffering \n That's  football  you  still  have  that  that \n euphoria  every  time  you  score  a  goal \n aanta  ball  en  in  laed  Yes  for  me  Yes  and  it \n creates  addiction  and  it  creates  addiction  you  still  get \n angry  when  you  don't  score  no  because  I  say  you \n get  to  a  moment  when  you  say  like  this  if  not  to \n score  a  game  two  you  miss  but  the \n moment  but  no  no  no  but  if  you  are \n in  the  80th  minute  and  you  haven't  scored  a  goal  yet \n but  you  are  there  yes  but  you  can't \n go  crazy  one  thing  you  try  to  want  to  do \n well  try  to  score  but  it  doesn't  happen \n obviously  you  get  frustrated  but  I  get  frustrated \n on  the  field  like  I  told  you  I  go  out \n and  end  up  thinking  about  the  next  day  thinking \n about  the  next  game  that  it's  going  to  go \n well  and  you're  going  to  score  a  goal   if  you  keep  a \n cool  head  you  get  angry  you  leave  on  the  field  you  go \n home  new  day  no  object  it's  like  that \n because  there  are  no  people  who  always  score  there  are  no \n people  who  play  well  there  are  no  people \n who  do  the  job  well  every  day \n but  what  are  you  going  to  do  Have  you  known  how  to  handle  that \n  \n yes  when  you  leave  football  do  you  rule  out  being  a \n coach  no  No  I  do \n n't \n want  to  why  I  tell  you  now  and  I  tell  you  I'm \n going  to  tell  you  in  5  years  10  years \n nothing  not  very  difficult  I  see  it  almost \n impossible  do  you  feel  more  like  having  your \n businesses  your  companies  are  you  studying \n a  lot  of  to  want  to  do  things  that  I  don't \n master  and  I  want  to  learn  you  are  curious  I  am  curious \n and  want  to  learn  something  else \n that  I  don't  master  that  I  think  is  the \n beautiful  thing  about  life  why  coach  not \n too  much  wear  and  tear  also  because  I \n played  football  all  my  life  all  my  life  and \n being  a  coach  I  think  is  even  more  difficult \n than  being  a  player  dealing  with  players  I \n think  it  is  difficult  my \n personality  I  don't  think  it \n adapts  very  well  to  being  a \n coach  I  think  now  but  that's  why  I \n tell  you  no  I  don't  need  to  be  a  coach  I  don't \n need  anything  related  to  football \n or   sports  director  or  buying  a  club \n not  sporting  director  not  owning  a \n club  makes  more \n sense  Quiz  Yes  Maybe  not  that  I  don't \n rule  out  if  it \n 's  business  yes  a  good  business  I  don't \n rule  out  you  have  a  club  in  mind \n no  because  football  is  very  momentary  moments \n like  business \n too  that  can  happen  but  being  a \n coach  sporting  director  same \n president  very  difficult  very  difficult  you  watch \n football  have  you  tired  of  playing  not  of  watching  I \n watch  from  time  to  time  yes  yes  yes  yes  I \n like  it  it's  my  passion  I'm  not  I  don't  watch  every \n day  but  from  time  to  time  I  watch  for \n example  Sporting  which  is  my  club  I  watch \n Manchester  from  time  to  time  I  watch  Real \n Madrid  the  Italian  league  you  watch  everything  not  from \n time  to  time  I'm  not  a  geek  but  go  from \n time  to  time  you  watch  Madrid  go  to  Madrid \n from  time  to  time  What  do  you  think  Because  my \n son  Mateo  likes  Mbappe  a  lot \n Mbappe  no  the  position  on  the  field  is \n playing  striker  eh  it  complicates  it  a  little \n more  for  Mbappe  because  he  doesn't \n know  how  to  play  striker  my  opinion  It's  not \n that  he  doesn't  know  it's  not  his  position  if  I \n had  it  in  Madrid  I  would  teach  him  to  play \n as  a  nine  because  I  was  not   forward  I \n got  used  to  playing  as  a  forward  I \n was  a  winger  people  forget  why \n Cristiano  scored  but  I  am  a  forward \n but  I'm  not  the  typical  forward  I  think \n he  should  do  it  not  be  the  typical \n forward  he  should  do  a  way  very  much  like \n him  or  rather  not  be  and  that  was  him  and  he  didn't \n play  more  or  less  like  Cristiano  plays \n as  a  forward  how  is  that  I  appear \n inside  the  area  I  am  not  inside  the \n area  you  are  not  between  the  center  backs \n exactly  when  I  play  like  this  nothing  works  out  for  me \n now  when  he  is  an \n unpredictable  player  and  he  has  conditions  he  is \n fast  he  is  powerful  he  can  appear  he  has \n speed  he  cannot  play  as  a  forward  he  cannot  be \n there  waiting  for  the  cross \n to  go  for  cza  Because  it  is  not  his  it  is \n his  virtue  in  the  head  he  has  to  appear  and  he \n has  legs  nowadays  to  do  it  if \n I  do  if  I  do  mpp  Don't  do  it  he \n has  to  do  it  but  take  care  of  him  take  care  of  him \n and  I  say  the  Madrid  fans  take  care  of  him  The \n kid  is  very  good  and  he  will  go  over  the \n top  Madrid  has  to  help  him \n protect  him  and  I  have  no  doubt  that  he  will \n give  the  Madrid  fans  a  lot  of  joy \n he  is  a  big  fan  of \n yours  I  love  him  a  lot  because  not  only  because  of \n the  history  he  had  as  a  young  man  who \n loved  him  a  lot   Christian  and  he  was  his  idol \n but  the  truth  is  that  I  see  him,  I  see  him  as  a \n star  and  I  think  he's  going  to  bring  a  lot  of \n joy  to  Real  Madrid,  eh  Vinicius,  the  Ballon \n d'Or  surprised  you,  yes,  it  surprised  me.  I \n think  Vinicius  should  win  the \n Ballon  d'Or  but  it  doesn't  surprise  me  either, \n not  only  because  I  didn't  win  or  because  I  didn't \n go,  it's  that  there's  no  credibility,  there's  no \n Vin,  he  won  the  Champions  League,  he  played  well,  he  made \n the  difference,  he  scored  goals,  you  know,  the \n whole  of  Madrid  didn't  go  to  the  gala,  he's  a  good  option  for  the \n club,  we  have  to  respect  him.  I've  already  been  through \n that.  You  don't  Sid,  to  many  galas. \n How  many  galas,  to  quite  a  few  galas,  no,  no, \n a  couple  of  galas,  no,  I  don't  know \n how  many  galas  he's  gone  to,  but  there  has  to  be \n more  credibility,  no  awards,  there  has  to \n be  something  more  serious  behind  it, \n and  it  disappoints  me,  and  it  disappointed  me  for \n Vinicius  because  it  was  something  that  he  deserved,  he \n \n completely  deserved  it,  but  for  me,  no,  no,  there's  no  belief, \n it's  something  that  you've  felt  many  times, \n what  Vinicius  felt  that  night  is, \n I've  already  felt  the  same,  I've  already  felt  the \n same  thing  twice  and  I  gave  you  impotence   r  it \n gave  you  impotence  but  then  I  understood  and \n you  when  you  understand  things  Well  no  V \n the  shame  certain  fights  that  you  are  not  going  to \n win  you  know  what  you  have  to  do  is \n retire  and  believe \n that  your  education  and  your  values ​​ are \n much  more  important  than  other  things  you \n like  l  yes  he  is  good  eh  I  think  he  has \n a  spectacular  future  too  he  is  going  to \n help  Real  Madrid  a  lot  he  is  a  player \n who  has  a  long  way  to  go  he \n reminds  me  a  lot  of  Zidan  and  he  has  a  lot  of \n future  he  is  similar  to  Zidan  playing  eh  he \n has  many  things  and  Zidan  the  way  of \n running  eh  stronger  less  less \n quality  less  it  is  that  Zid  was  brilliant  he \n was  beautiful  but  Bellingham  is  21  22 \n years  old  21  years  old  to  have  the  whole  future  in \n front  of  him  That  is  why  I  think  he  is  going  to  give  a \n lot  to  Madrid  because  the  kid  I  think  he \n will  be  a  star  Ancelotti  has \n been  criticized \n a  lot  he  has  won  the  league  and  the  Champions  League  and \n 5  months  later  it  seems  that  everything  has  been \n forgotten  do  you  like  Ancelotti  as  a \n coach  yes  I  like  Carl \n Ancelotti  a  lot  a  spectacular  person  a \n gentleman  of  football  we  won  many  things \n together  but  it  is  normal  mis  knows  that  the \n pressure  of   Real  Madrid  is  like  that  the  club \n is  like  that  and  you  have  to  be  used  to  it \n but  in  football  it's  also  like  that  when  you \n get  results  when  you  don't  win  a  club \n of  that  magnitude  it's  difficult  then  to  continue  like  this \n how  the  coaches  are  the \n perfect  coach  for  you  has  to  have \n been  a  player  who  a \n perfect  coach  the  perfect  coach  has  to  have \n been  a  player  before  coach  I \n think  that  9%  of  the  time  he  helps,  helps  it  does \n n't  make  the  difference \n a  guy  who  is  not  a  coach  who  has  never \n been  inside  a  locker  room  who  hasn't \n been  in  a  session  who  hasn't  dealt  with  it's \n very  difficult  it's  very  difficult  That's  why  I \n tell  you  you  see  the  history  of \n football  the  best  of  all  time  yes  of  the \n 50  48  were  players  there  are  sessions \n obviously  like  everything  in  life  but  48  this \n giving  you  an  example  were  players  do  you \n have  a  favorite  coach  no  I \n learned  from  all  yes  I  learned  from  all \n some  less \n good  well  there  are  many  some  very  bad \n Yes  yes  some  are  very  bad  because  of  the  management \n of  mission  also  it's  that  he  doesn't  have  a  [  __  ] \n idea  about  football  it  comes  that  I  think  he's  the \n last  last  cookie  of  yes  the \n last  coke  in  the  desert  the  last \n coke  in  the  desert  but  it's  normal \n everything  you  know  already   I'm  so  used  to  it  and \n life  happens,  it's  like  that,  you  know,  it \n 's  not  normal,  you  know,  but  it's  happened  to  me,  really \n bad  times,  the  truth  is,  I  go,  I  go  a  lot  to  the  club.  Well,  I \n always  go  to  the  Bernabeu  when  there's  a  game \n and  you  know  what  all  the  people  tell  me, \n not  every  time  they \n see  me,  how  is  Cristiano?  Tell \n Cristiano  that  we  miss  him  very \n well,  give  him  a  hug, \n Cristiano,  here  in  Arabia.  Maybe  in \n Turin  or  in  Manchester,  you  don't  realize  how  much \n Real  Madrid  misses  you, \n man,  I  like  it,  it's  like  you  say,  it's \n my  home,  Spain,  my  children  grew  up \n there,  their  mentality,  I  speak  Spanish, \n my  friends,  I  played  for  Real  Madrid  for  many  years,  it \n was  maybe  where  I  was  happiest \n football-wise,  obviously  I'll \n always  have  Real  Madrid  in  my  heart,  that's  why  I'm \n glad  that  people  still \n remember  him,  he's  done  very \n important  things  there,  very  beautiful  things,  and  that's  why \n people  don't  forget  when  you \n leave  a  legacy  and  a  mark,  people  do \n n't  forget,  but  kids,  maybe  when  you  were  9 \n years  old,  you  left  for  Real  Madrid,  YouTube,  a  lot  of \n YouTube,  why  are  we  talking  about  it \n before,  let's  see  how  it's  possible  that \n 9  10  year  old  boy  tell  me  [  __  ] \n give  Cristiano  a  hug  I'm  a \n Cristiano  fan  when  you  went  to  Madrid \n the  kid  was  3  years  old  how  can  it  be  that \n your  legacy  is  this  phase  that  you  have \n social  media  youtubers  continue  and  I \n keep  scoring  I'm  still  doing  well  you  know \n my  celebrations  that  seems  like  a  way  that \n people  get  invra  you  know  get \n involved  in  that  and  it's  normal  because \n I  also  watch  my  children  I  get  home \n sometimes  Mateo  is  there  I  sell  YouTube  I  sell \n players  I  sell  you  know  which  players \n Mateo  he  likes  Bellingham  he \n likes  bed  vinga  he  likes  Mbappe  a  lot \n Mbappe  yes  yes  it  pisses  me  off  sometimes  why  how  it \n pisses  you  dad  Mbappe  better  than  you  such  me \n no  dad  is  better  than  Mbappe  I  have  more \n goals  than  him  you \n know  joke  and  he  missed  a  penalty  yeah  yeah \n but  you  missed  it  too  it's  very  funny  it's \n very  funny  Cristiano  Why  did  you \n leave \n Madrid  because  I  wanted  a  different  stage  in \n my  life  in  my  cycle  there  I  think  I \n was  already  locked  up  Yeah  I  wanted  something \n different  a  different  motivation  it  was \n more   It  was  that  year  in  which  we  said  on  El \n Chiringuito  that  you  were  leaving.  Did \n your  departure  from  Madrid  wear  you  down  a  lot?  No, \n the  truth  is  that  it  wasn't  just  a  matter  of \n us,  not  the  media.  Yes,  no,  it  didn't \n wear me down. \n Because  it  was  something  that  the \n president  said.  The  president  accepted,  he  accepted \n that  I  could  leave  at  that  time \n when  we  were  in  a \n negotiation  phase.  He  didn't  behave  well \n with  me.  I  understand  because  that's  how  he \n always  does  it.  And  then  I  couldn't  go \n back.  I  had  already  given  my \n word  there  at  Juve  and  then  the \n president  wanted  to  go  back.  You  know,  it  was \n a  long  story,  a  wear  and  tear  in  that \n aspect,  but  I  appreciate,  I  really  appreciate \n Florentino.  I  think  he's  a  worthy \n president,  a  serious  person,  a  person \n who  treated  me  well  and  with  whom  we  won  many \n things  together.  And  I  have  a  lot  of  respect \n for  him.  Do  you  speak  to  him  from  time  to  time? \n With  Florentino?  Yes,  a  message  from  time  to \n time.  Yes,  yes,  yes.  We  have  to  organize  your \n return  to  the  Bernabeu, \n man.  One  day,  maybe  you'd \n like  to,  I  wouldn't  rule  it  out  because,  as  he \n told  you,  I  left  a  legacy.  I  left  a \n nice  mark  there,  maybe  when  it's  over.   the \n race  something  could  happen  there  80,000 \n people  80,000  people  is  going  to  be \n something  cool  I  don't  rule  it  out  because  it's  a  club \n that  responds  a  lot  it's  that  you  are  not \n aware  of  what  the  people  miss \n you  really  I  do  because  I  am  in  I  am  in \n well  I  am  in  the  street  I \n am  with  the  people  I  am  with  the \n fans  But  you  are  not  aware \n but  eh  you  don't  regret  not  seeing  no \n I  don't  regret  Because  everything  that  has \n happened  in  my  life  has  a \n reason  for  being  and  I  am  very  happy \n here  and  I  want  to  continue  here  but  Madrid \n marked  me  and  continues  to  mark  me  there  were  years \n of  great  tension  of  great  rebellion \n especially  with  El  Barça  with  El  Barça  of \n Guardiola  it  was  Guardiola  more  normal  it  was \n the  good  thing  people  today  value \n saying  when  it  was  Madrid  Barcelona  was \n much  more  How  was  that  lived  there  was  a  lot  of \n tension  Ah  we  lived  a  week  with \n tension  because  of  the  lubres  but  it  was  it  was \n beautiful  it  was  good  attention  the  fans \n the  televisions  talking  about  the  game  it  was \n beautiful  it  was  a  great  rivalry  Madrid \n Barcelona  Cristiano  Messi  obviously  but \n now  also  Piqué  and  Sergio  Ramos   Pepe \n well  Forgive  me  Piqué  and  Ramos  less  than \n Cristiano  and  Messi  Yes  but  we  talked  about \n everything  you  know  but  it  was  more  Cristiano  and \n Messi  obviously  but  it  was  nice  it  was  that \n rivalry  that  existed  that  was  healthy  they \n talk  about  Messi  as  if  he  were  your  enemy  you  have \n never  had  a  bad  relationship  with  him  it  has \n never  been  the  other  way  around  we  shared \n the  awards  stage  for  15  years  and  we  always  and \n always  get  along  very  well  you  know  and  and  I \n even  remember  one  another  time  when  I  was \n translating  what  he  was  saying  in  English  to \n translate  because  Messi  you  are  going  to  stay  here \n here  and  Ah  V  to  ask  you  a  question \n and  I  was  translating  for  him  or  rather  in  the \n organization  before  the \n gala  started  the  presenter  would  tell  you  let's \n do  this  and  you  translated  for \n Messi  and  she  was  funny  she  always \n treated  me  well  But  obviously  he  defended  his \n Club  and  he  defended  mine  his  national  team  and  I  defended  mine \n Maybe  it's  possible  that  you  can  give  us \n feedback  on  your  level  in  terms  of \n goals,  I  think  yes  mutually \n mutually  I  think  there  were  years  when  he \n wanted  to  play  everything  and  score  and  also  that \n healthy  fight  as  it  existed  Maybe  I  don't \n know  Aon  c  prost  Of  course   that  motivated \n each  other  and  I  think  that  we  will \n see  those  numbers  of  Cristiano  and  Messi  again.  I \n hope  it  would  be  very  good  for  football \n but  I  see  it  difficult  sincerely  I  see  it \n difficult \n eh  but  it  is  possible  you  never \n know  I  don't  know  I \n \n \n \n \n \n see  it  very  difficult  I  see  it  almost  impossible  we  will  see  we  will  see  you  were  eh  hated  football-wise  especially  at  the  Camp  n  at  the  stadium  of  the  was  the  biggest  rival  that  Madrid  had  it  was  normal  I  liked  playing  there  like  I  don't  know  how  many  goals  he  has  scored  at  Camp  but  I  have \n scored  many  7  18  19  20  goals  the  same  as \n Juva  I  also  scored  yes  it  was  a  stadium \n where  I  liked  to  play  I  came  up  because  they \n whistled  at  me  there  was  a  different  time  there \n in  the  stadium  I  liked  are  you  able  to \n abstract  from  what  the  public  says \n when  they  insult  you  they \n insult  you  obviously  because  but  you \n listen  to  it  no  you  are  playing  on  the \n wing  and  you  listen  you  listen  but  you \n think  about  just  doing  well  making  the \n difference  to  try  to  score  a  goal  to  be \n able  to  shut  those  people  up  that  is  what \n I  thought  you  liked  scoring  a  goal  more  at \n the  C  no  than  at  the  Bernabeu   Understand  me  yes  yes  yes  yes  yes  I  understand \n clear  calm \n calm \n and  all  they  were  whistling  warming  up  silv  that's  the \n beautiful  thing  about  football  calm  calm  yes  it \n came  from  there  calm  that  I  am  here \n that  the  little  bug  V  to  make  the  difference  and  it \n came  from  there  you  won  Ah  that \n league  Cris  before  arriving  at  Manchester \n when  you  were  18  years  old  you  could  play  for \n Barça  yes  it  was  a  phase  that  I  was  there \n playing  for  Sporting  and  I  could  go  to \n several  clubs  and  one  of  them  was  Barça \n I  remember  having  been \n with  a  person  from  Barça  and  he \n wanted  to  hire  me  Did  you  go  to  Barcelona \n or  was  it  to  Lisbon?  They  went  to  Lisbon  to  be \n with  me  and  yes  yes  yes  And  why  And  why  did \n n't  you  say  Barça,  see  why  no  no  it  didn't \n happen  because  maybe  he  wanted  to \n hire  me  and  wanted  to  take  me  the \n following  year  and  he  took  a  club  that  was \n Manchester  that  arrived  and  took  me  at  the \n same  minute,  I  mean,  and  I  went  there  that  you  know \n that  in  football  everything  is  very  fast  but \n how  everything  changes  eh  I  mean  destiny \n changes  in  this  it's  like  that  destiny  is  like  that \n the  history  of  football  with  you  at \n Barça  well  well   Well  I  don't  want  to \n even  imagine  it  I  think  it  could  be  very \n similar  what  what  no  What  are  you  saying \n man  Madrid  is  Madrid  is  another  story \n madri  is  Mad  okay  but  Madrid  is  I \n say  my  future  as  a  player  Ah  yes \n Well  it  was  very  similar  you  know  no  obviously \n Madrid  my  opinion  and  it's  the  biggest  club \n in  the  world  and  and  the  best  in  terms  of \n stress  you  more  Followers  in  the  world  more \n goes  you  have  stress  in  your  life  we ​​ all \n have  stress  but  you  have  to  manage \n stress  calmly  you  make  a  good  life \n  \n eh  being  with  doing  your  job  well  noar \n nothing  n  for  going  to  bed  peacefully \n you  sleep  well  you  sleep  well  thank  God  I \n sleep  very  well  Well \n clear  conscience  what  do  you  sleep  7  8  hours  8  hours \n straight  almost  always  yes  I  sleep  8  hours  I \n rest  well  to  be  able  to  be \n perfect  the  next  day  for  whatever  I  have  to \n do  penalties  surely  the \n most  tense  or  nerve-wracking  situation \n for  a  player  within  the  90 \n minutes  How  do  you  manage  that  what  is  your \n routine  for  penalties  well  first  of  all \n be  confident  that  you  are  going  to  score \n okay  And  I  think  that  is  the \n fundamental  point  secondly  there  will  always \n be  doubts  already  always  but  that  makes \n part  not  only  of  football  but  life \n too  and  thinking  positive  thinking \n positive  Well  that  you're  going  to  score  and  and  and  and \n it's  like  that  before  starting  a  game  you \n think  Yes  if  there's  a  penalty  I'll  shoot  it \n here  for  example  Yes  for  doubts  example \n But  you  say  for  example  well  you're  on \n the  bus  maybe  going  to  the  stadium  and \n you  say  today  it  goes  here  Today  it  goes  here  but  you \n take  the  ball  and  sometimes  you  change  but  it's \n part  of  you  There  are  things  in  the  mind  that \n you  can't  control  there  your \n mind  says  move  here  a  part  of  your \n mind  says  move  throw  there  they  are \n decisions  they  are  decisions  that  you  will  always \n make  in  life  and  it's  intuition  many \n of  the  times  I  think  that  the  most \n important  point  in  football  is  intuition  and \n I  follow  many  of  my  intuitions  you  still \n get  nervous  in  a  FR  I  always \n always  get  nervous  one  thing  you \n get  nervous  and  you  don't  shoot  one  thing  you \n get  nervous  and  you  shoot  the  real \n Valente  is  not  me  who  arrives  at  a  bridge  and \n shoots  without  fear  he  always  shoots  with \n fear  He  arrives  he  is  afraid  but  he  shoots \n what  he  doesn't  Valente  arrives  he  is  afraid  he \n goes  back  but  what  he  shoots  he \n shoots   with  fear  of  course  you  understand  I  take  a \n penalty  with  fear  nothing  happens  but  I \n take  it  and  if  you  miss  you  miss  Well  bad \n luck  you  know  and  there's  another  one  you  take  it  is  that  I  have  to \n take  it \n why  Because  if  you  get  used  to \n taking  penalties  for  20  years  and  it  happens  to  be  a  day  that  you  don't \n want  people  are  going  to  say  what's  going  on  it's \n [  __  ]  up  it's  that  there's  no  room  to \n tell  me  for  me  to  say  no  no  Cos  it's  you \n score  a  penalty  and  you  give  the  ball  to  another \n saying  you  score  now  because  I  already \n scored  but  the  first  one  if  you  are \n used  to  scoring  penalties  all  your  life  there \n comes  a  time  when  you  don't  kill \n anymore  but  I  also  respect  the  player \n who  misses  and  gives  the  ball  to  another  and  say  dude \n you  because  I  missed  TR  days  and \n maybe  I'm  not  mentally  clean \n too  it  exists  you  know  we  are  not  all  the \n same  and  you  shouldn't  blame  whoever  it  is  like  that  it  is  already \n difficult  it  is  difficult  to \n put  yourself  in  the  shoes  of  who  misses  it  the \n pressure  of  speaking  the  press  the \n stadium  is  the  side  to  fail  it  is  not \n easy  you  know  it  is  very  difficult  do  you  remember \n what  is  the  most  tense  penalty  that  you  have \n taken  it  is  difficult  to  mention  one \n always   the  big  finals  Those  are  the  ones  with  the \n most  tension \n Champions  League  final  against  Atlético  for  example \n Champions  League  final  final  of  a  European  Championship \n or  so  there  the  heart  rate  is  at  1000  not  at \n And  what  do  you  do  you  breathe  you  try  to  calm  down \n calm  down  take  a \n couple  of  breaths  and  always  think  positive  you \n know  and  the  one  of \n Black  that  Black  stopped  you  in  the \n European  Championship  was  one  of  the  ones  that  hurt  you  the  most  It \n hurt  me  like  the  others \n Maybe  a  little  more  because  I  looked  at  my  mom \n and  I  saw  him  there \n overwhelmed  crying  and  that's  why  I  was \n a  little  frustrated  to  see  it  not  because  of  the \n fact  of  failing  because  failing  is \n part  of  it  I  give  Black  a  lot  of  credit \n because  he  made  a  spectacular  save \n but  they  are  feelings  that  you  have  and  I'm \n not  ashamed  of  that  because \n I  am  what  I  am  I  won  what  I  won  and  I \n continue  to  win  what  I  win  for  having  some \n merit  of  of  of  having  personality  of \n continuing  to  make  mistakes  continuing  to  get  it  right \n and  continuing  to  go  ahead  you  know  That's  the \n most  important  thing  for  me  you  see  The \n Chiringuito  from  time  to  time  I  don't  see  the \n truth  is  that  I  don't  social  networks \n social  networks  Yes  it's  very  late  here  there  are \n 3  hours  difference  and  since  I  go  to  sleep \n early  it's  difficult  to  keep  up  with  the \n news  from  Europe  we  have  a  good  time  El \n Chiringuito  Yes  yes  very  well  you  have \n always  loved  us  a  lot  or  rather  you  in  the \n chiringuito  always  always  have  accepted  a \n lot  of  criticism  from  those  who \n criticized  you  a  lot  you  have  never  given  it  much \n importance  it's  that  you  don't  have  to  give  it \n importance  what  am  I  going  to  do  it's \n normal  you  know  no  the  criticism \n will  always  pass  it  will  always  pass  as  a  player  not \n being  a  player  it  will  always  pass  but  I  have  a \n lot  I  appreciate  a  lot  of  people  who \n are  mainly  those  who  are  from  Real \n Madrid  Pedro  rol  also  everyone  I  have \n a  special  affection  jero  who  is  there  the \n people  I  like  a  debate  program  it's \n nice  there  is  a  debate  there  there  are  good \n healthy  discussions  rivalries  some \n without  sense  because  I  see  a  lot  of  cism  from \n time  to  time  yes  no  eh \n Yes  and  for  example  what  I  said  yesterday  in \n the  goal  scorer's  car  for  example  that  it \n was  already  4  years  ago  you  showed  an  I  thought  it \n was  recent  you  didn't  show  me  a  video  in \n which  we  were  debating  El \n Chiringuito  about  Who  is  the  best \n top  scorer  in  history  there  are  things  that  don't  make \n sense  But  I  understand  the \n rivalry  by  numbers  is  that  What  does  top \n scorer  mean  the  word  numbers  is  that  it \n is  the  number  of  who  puts  the  ball \n inside  the  rectangle  then  there  are  styles \n even  it  is  something  else  already  What  is  the  greatest \n goal  scorer  in  history  are  numbers \n Full  stop  giving  an  example  styles  ways \n vanel  Roy  center  forward  ron  I \n could  also  say \n what  does  the  player  in  history \n who  has  scored  the  most  goals  with  his  head \n left  foot  penalty  foul  all  added  together  you \n know  there  are  several  things  left  foot  I \n am  for  example  I  was  watching  the  other \n day  in  history  I  am  not  being \n left-footed \n the  top  10  players  who  scored  the  most \n goals  with  their  left  foot  It's  that  you  hit  hard \n with  your  left  foot  and  with  your \n head  and  with  your  right  I'm  not \n talking  to  you  about  the  right  and  penalties  I  mean  what  are  you \n telling  me  and  fouls  You  must  be  there  no \n cl  obviously  I'm  in  everything  you're  not  going  to \n tell  me \n humility  I'm  saying  numbers \n numbers  in  numbers  is  that  you  have  to \n talk  about  the  numbers  I  believe  that  I  am  the \n most  complete  player  that  existed  my \n opinion  one  thing  is  a  taste  of  I  believe \n that's  me  because  I  play  everything  well, \n I  do  everything  in  soccer,  I  play  well  with  my \n head,  I  shoot  well  with  my \n left  foot,  you  know,  I'm  fast,  I'm  strong,  I \n jump,  you  know,  I  mean,  one  thing  is  taste   s \n say  this  this  this  do  you  like  Messi \n or  Pelé  or  Maradona  more?  I  understand  that  and  I \n respect  it  but  to  say  that  Cristiano  is  not \n complete  is  a  lie.  Am  I  the  most  complete? \n Are  you  the  best  in  history?  I \n think  so.  Honestly,  I  haven't  seen  anyone \n better  than  me,  but  I'm  telling  you  from  the  bottom  of  my  heart.  You've \n never  had  an  idol.  I  haven't  had \n people  that  I've  liked  very,  very \n much,  an  idol,  an  idol  to  idolize,  to \n copy.  No,  that's  not  it,  not  even  when  I  was  little,  no, \n I  remember  that.  What  can  you  say?  He's \n kind  and  cool.  What  about  Fabio,  who \n always \n accompanied  me,  I  liked  him,  but  sweet.  Attract \n like  that,  in  terms  of  copying  that,  I  think  not.  What  is \n the  Cristiano  like  that  people  don't  see? \n Cris,  to  finish  the  interview,  eh.  Look,  the \n best  player  in  the  world,  rich,  handsome, \n followers,  what  is  it  that  people  don't  see \n about  Cristiano?  People  don't  see  what  they  don't  want  to  see. \n I  can't  control  that. \n People  see  what  they  want  to  see.  Like  I've \n told  you,  I'm  happy  the  way  I  am,  I'll  continue \n being  the  way \n I  am,  I  don't  care  what  people  think \n of  me  and  I'll  continue  being  the  same.  I'll  be \n with  the  people  who  love  me,  the  fans,  the  ones  who  love  me.   What \n people  who  don't  like  me  want \n is  that  I  don't  care  and  I  will  continue  doing \n little  things  for  football  until  I  play \n tempting  people  so  much,  so  much \n for  my  children,  my  family  and  continuing  to \n enjoy  this  which  is  the  most \n important  thing.  I  want  to  thank  you \n in  front  of  everyone  for  like  a \n hug  to  everyone  for  how  you  have  always  treated  me \n because  with  this  interview  I \n want  people  to  get  closer  to \n Cristiano  to  finish  I  have  a  question \n the  most \n direct  Who  is  more  handsome  you  or  me \n both  Thanks  Cris  You're  welcome  brother",
