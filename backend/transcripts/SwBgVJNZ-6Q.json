  "transcript": "what  if  I  told  you  this  dogcoin  could \n make  you  Millions  but  not  in  the  way  you \n expect  most  Cryptor  online  are  telling \n you  that  hot  dogcoin  is  going  to  100x  by \n tomorrow  or  that  Bitcoin  is  going  to  be \n $1  million  this  buard  run  and  you  should \n get  in  now  but  the  problem  99%  of  people \n aren't  going  to  make  any  money  from  it \n the  reality  is  even  some  of  the  smartest \n end  up  losing  thousands  and  even \n millions  and  today  I'm  going  to  show  you \n what  the  true  opportunity  is  behind  this \n bull  run  and  how  I  turned  the  $2,000  I \n lost  from  trying  to  trade  crypto  into \n six  biger  personal  brand  there  is  one \n thing  behind  the  biggest  Financial \n revolution  of  our  times  think  about \n it  how  has  something  so  complicated  such \n as  Finance  become  so  simple  why  did  a \n cryptocoin  with  a  face  of  a  dog  make \n billions  the  answer  is  the  same \n underlying  phenomenon  you  see  every  day \n when  you  scroll  on  social  media  and  it's \n not  just  luck  or  time  in  the  market  it's \n the  ability  to  build  something  from  just \n one  thing  Community  see  if  we  analyze \n the  points  where  these  meme  coins \n actually  blow  up  and  compare  it  to  the \n points  where  people  were  talking  about \n them  the  most  everything  makes  sense  and \n this  mirr  is  the  exact  same  path  that \n your  favorite  online  entrepreneurs  and \n creators  have  taken  alexos  Elon  Musk \n Cody  Sanchez  they  all  craft  community \n building  and  how  they  are  all  growing \n every  single  day  in  2021  I  was  all  in  on \n crypto  not  even  knowing  what  it  was  I \n kind  of  knew  finance  and  basic  investing \n knowledge  but  I  learned  more  in  my  6 \n months  of  following  Dogecoin  mememe \n accounts  on  Twitter  than  any  book  could \n ever  teach  me  my  crypto  Investments  may \n have  not  made  me  any  money  but  the \n lessons  I  learned  trading  100%  did  it \n all  starts  with  building  a  personal \n brand  so  here  are  the  five  core \n components  that  you  can  use  this  bull \n run  to  not  get  left  behind  and  make \n money  online  even  if  you're  not  gambling \n sorry  investing  the  first  key  component \n is \n accessibility  think  about  it  information \n is  currency  in  this  attention  economy \n whoever  is  able  to  to  provid  it  in  the \n quickest  and  simplest  way  wins  the \n reason  why  you  like  learning  from \n YouTube  and  not  school  is  because  most \n good  content  online  will  cut  through  the \n noise  and  endless  jargon  and  it's \n exactly  what  meme  coins  have  done  they \n use  memes  as  a  vehicle  to  spread \n information  it  turned  something  so \n complex  simple  teenagers  who  fail  at \n school  were  turning  hundreds  of  dollars \n into  thousands  because  of  me  simplified \n Financial  jargon  it  also  made  Finance \n welcoming  for  years  the  industries  have \n been  using  technical  language  to \n position  it  only  for  the  elite  and  this \n is  why  when  you  create  content  for  your \n personal  run  you  need  to  remember  one \n key  thing  make  complex  information \n simple  accessible  to  a  broad  audience \n cut  the  fluff  move  out  from  paragraphs \n and  be  concise  use  conversational \n language  use  more  use  and  yours  and  less \n academic  language  simplify  concepts  for \n example  if  you're  trying  to  create \n content  on  sales  funnels  for  businesses \n don't  tell  them  the  entire  concept  of \n the  background  or  mlo  H  your  needs  break \n down  the  steps  to  build  a  successful \n funnel  instead  if  you're  trying  to  get \n people  to  buy  your  product  or  service \n don't  tell  them  the  benefits  tell  them \n the  features  the  second  key  component  is \n storytelling  most  people  invest  into \n crypto  because  of  the  story  they  tell \n themselves  the  story  of  all  the  money \n they'll  make  when  their  coin  gives  them \n 100x  returns  in  2  weeks  all  the  Lambos \n the  Rolexes  the  luxury  du  buy  apartment \n it's  all  a  narrative  that  people  buy \n into  even  as  a  young  woman  I  bought  into \n it  that  is  storytelling  at  scale  is  what \n the  vial  does  it's  what  entrepreneurs  do \n listen  we  are  all  telling  stories  us \n need  to  make  yours  good  enough  so  all \n the  people  want  to  listen  to  it  too  and \n the  secret  tool  that  makes  stories  great \n emotion  you  can  do  this  by  making \n someone  curious  for  example  in  a  post \n last  year  I  said  I'm  rich  in  the  opening \n line  This  triggered  people's  curiosity \n which  incentivized  them  to  read  or  you \n can  also  trigger  fear  Finance  accounts \n do  this  very  well  when  they  talk  about \n how  it  is  your  last  chance  to  invest \n before  everybody  else  by  S  for  the  fifth \n time  in  a  week  alternatively  you  can \n also  make  people  feel  inspired  talk \n about  how  you've  been  a  100  day  so  or \n how  you've  lost  30s  in  the  past  year  the \n point  is  to  communicate  online  in  a  way \n that  evokes  emotion  in  your  audience \n you're  narrating  a  transformation  they \n may  want  to  have  going  from  A  to  B \n addiction  to  sobriety  broke  to  rich  fat \n to  fit  it  is  so  a  story  the  third  key \n component  is  your  identity  capital  and \n this  is  literally  just  being  interesting \n Alex  Becka  interesting  Lara  Costa \n interesting  dove  with  hat  meme  coin \n definitely  interesting  all  these \n interesting  factors  range  from  building \n and  exiting  a  B2B  SAS  to  literally \n writing  cool  stuff  on  LinkedIn  these \n experiences  skills  and  stories  make  you \n interesting  and  they  also  attract \n interesting  people  I'm  as  good  at \n marketing  and  branding  today  because  I \n obsessively  consume  crypto  mean  coin \n marketing  for  months  which  leted  me  to \n understand  fundamentals  of  marketing  in \n a  year  instead  of  three  2  years  later  I \n built  an  agency  based  on  the  exact \n fundamentals  I  learned  scrolling  online \n I  was  developing  a  skill  useless  at  the \n time  but  a  skill  at  least  just  because \n something  is  invaluable  now  like  that  or \n reading  52  bucks  in  52  weeks  it  doesn't \n mean  that  it  won't  be  valuable  later  so \n to  build  on  your  identity  Capital  start \n with  one  telling  your  story  two  know  who \n you're  talking  to  and  three  be  weird \n embrace  it  and  with  that  being  said  the \n fourth  key  component  is  community  and \n this  is  what  99%  of  people  get  wrong \n people  start  a  telegram \n WhatsApp  group  or  even  a  school \n Community  thinking  that's  all  there  is \n to  it  just  creating  a  community  false  a \n community  is  where  you  turn  followers \n into  fans  and  you  do  this  by  identifying \n the  one  thing  you  and  someone  from  the \n other  side  of  the  world  with  an  entirely \n different  life  have  in  common  where \n people  feel  like  they  belong  Dogecoin \n didn't  just  go  viral  because  of  its \n economics  it  did  because  it  was  funny  it \n understood  internet  culture  and  it  gave \n people  outside  the  realm  of  finance  a \n sense  of  belonging  newer  coins  like  Nomi \n or  dog  with  hat  are  doing  the  exact  same \n thing  they  are  leveraging  the  internet \n culture  and  entertainment  if  you're \n building  a  community  do  the  same  it \n doesn't  start  with  telegram  slack  School \n Circle  or  Facebook  group  it  starts  with \n you  and  what  you  stand  for  that  a  bunch \n of  other  the  people  stand  for  too  and \n this  ladies  and  gentlemen  is  how  you \n build  a  cold  following  what  do  you  stand \n for  are  you  team  Apple  are  you  team  PC \n are  you  team  Academia  or  team \n self-education  what  is  the  US  versus \n them  narrative  behind  your  personal \n brand  for  example  I  think  the  education \n system  is  broken  and  so  is  the  rat  race \n my  content  about  this  polarizes  and \n repels  many  people  but  it  also  attracts \n the  right  people  like  you  guys  watching \n this  video  about  meme  coins  thank  you  I \n love  you  because  guess  what  that's  what \n makes  me  authentic  not  because  I  share \n inspiring  quotes  from  Steve  Jobs  or  do \n q&as  on  my  Instagram  stories  I  do  cool \n stuff  that  cool  stuff  is  turning  to \n content  and  sometimes  it  makes  money  but \n for  the  first  two  years  of  me  posting  on \n social  media  I  did  didn't  make  a  single \n penny  I  focused  on  community  building \n and  connecting  a  lot  and  that's  what \n online  pass  run  is  too  you  hang  out \n online  connecting  with  people  that \n you're  alike  you  learn  from  them  they \n learn  from  you  one  of  you  grows  and  the \n other  one  grows  it's  a  cycle  in  why \n communities  win  now  the  fifth  component \n is  Market  timing  just  like  you  buy  low \n and  sell  High  building  your  personal \n brand  is  kind  of  similar  most  people \n post  content  film  videos  and  create \n podcasts  mindlessly  and  never  see  any \n results  until  and  I  know  this  because \n because  I've  fixed  many  of  these  cases \n with  the  client  in  my  agency  until  they \n understand  market  trends  they  see  what \n content  people  are  looking  for  in  what \n content  and  in  what  style  for  example  on \n LinkedIn  in  2022  it  was  about  stories \n then  2023  swipeable  carousels  then  now \n shifting  back  to  corporate  storytelling \n talking  about  remote  work  on  Tik  Tok \n well  everything  went  viral  with  that \n format  in  2020  then  it  was  trending \n audios  and  now  more  on  to  long  form \n storytelling  with  consistent  retention \n tactics  and  then  on  Twitter  and  yeah \n Twitter  is  like  dying  so  we  don't  talk \n about  it  right  now  the  point  is  you  need \n to  know  what  the  trends  are  what  the \n shifts  are  in  the  algorithms  and  make \n sure  you  leverage  what  you  have  to  what \n is  coming  and  a  live  example  that  I  can \n give  you  that  you  can  go  look  at  right \n now  is  my  YouTube  channel  me  and  my  team \n identifying  that  how-to  content  AI \n LinkedIn  and  lead  generation  topics  are \n hot  so  what  did  I  do  I  made  content  on \n it  it  just  makes  sense  I'm  not  changing \n my  message  just  changing  the  way  I  say \n it  so  kings  and  queens  while  everybody \n is  all  in  on  crypto  be  all  in  on  your \n personal  brand  because  your  best \n lifetime  investment  will  always  be  your \n name  use  this  five  components  to  build \n your  stew  document  your  journey  and \n build  the  personal  brand  of  your  dreams \n that's  literally  it  this  video  was  not \n Financial  advice  please  don't  buy  any \n points  mentioned  in  this  video  just \n build  your  personal  brand  okay  bye",
