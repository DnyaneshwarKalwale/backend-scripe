  "transcript": "[MUSIC] \n Yeti  found  in  the  lap  of  Himalayas. \n \n Identified  by  local  people  in  a  small  village  of  Manali.   Brother,  I  had  gone  up  for  trekking.   I \n saw  such  a  big  Yeti  there. \n So  you  saved  your  tracking  group \n earlier,  right?   No  brother,  no.   I  clicked  the  photo  and \n added  a  new  activity  to  my  package. \n This  was  side  scene  500  only. \n Yo  I'm  just  so  excited  for  this  guy. \n Yeti  is  a  new  cool  man.   I  want  to  live  a \n yeti  life.   I  heard  that  Yeti  has  come  to  Earth \n and  is  tampering  with  things  created  by  nature.   Only  these \n [  __  ]  boys  will  be  considered  friends. \n Move  your  head.   I  had  told  you  that  there  are  yogis. \n But  you  people  did  not  agree.    The \n joke  is  on  you. \n hey  what's  the  joke?   You  are  joking  again. \n [Music] \n So  Rawat  watch  the  status  on  Himalayan  theme \n project,  sir  you  know  what  problem  we  are  facing, \n Khanna  builder  people  are  putting  a  lot  of  pressure  on \n us  because  we  had  told  them  that \n their  Himalayan  theme  park  project  will  start  as  soon  as \n possible  but  after  this  news \n all  the  work  has  stopped,  Rawat,  we  cannot  afford \n to  lose  that  project. \n Everyone  from  top  to  bottom  in  the  Forest  Department  has  been \n given  money  to  get  that  land.   Call  someone  who  can \n find  out  whether  it  is  there  or  not.   And  if  it  is,  then \n we  need  to  neutralize  it.   But  sir, \n who  will  take  such  a  big  risk? \n [MUSIC] \n [MUSIC] \n So  friends,  let's  do  something  crazy  today \n [MUSIC]. \n I  am  Bear  Grylls.   Knowing  closely  about  the \n dangerous  and  mysterious  places  and  creatures  of  the  world  is \n not  my  hobby  but  a  necessity.   To \n fulfil  this  need,  today  I  am  being  sent \n to  the  lap  of  the  Himalayas.   Searching  for  a  mysterious \n Yeti  who  has  been  seen \n near  the  cave  on  top  of  South  Mountain.   There  are \n going  to  be  many  deadly  twists  on  this  mission.   But \n drive  the  cart  straight,  hobbyist.   Sunu  I  turned  it  off  there  is  no \n load.   Chak  de  phate  napde  killi  o \n night  hi  maru  cat.   Tell  me  Tara, \n friends,  our  chopper  is  ready.   We  are  going  to \n fly  over  the  mighty  mountains  in  search  of  a  unique \n victory  and  accompanying  me  in  this  mission  will  be \n Sher  Jin  Sharma  whose \n coordinates  I  have  received.   Let's  go. \n  \n So  friends,  right  now  we  are  at  an  altitude  of  about  37,000  feet \n and  Sherba's  coordinates  are \n matching  here,  so  I  will \n have  to  leave.   Hey  but  listen,  this  is \n not  the  time  to  listen  or  tell  my  friend. \n We  have  very  little  time  to  find  momentum.   We \n have  to  leave.   Hey  but  listen  sorry \n friend  my  parachute  is  ready  and  I  am  leaving. \n Bye-bye  hey  but \n take  the  parachute  bag  with  you. \n O  brother  who  is  this?   This  is  brother. \n This  is  our  brother.   Brother, \n where  is  your  parachute?   Where  did  you  fall  from?   Are \n you  okay?   Maybe  some  bones  are  broken,  Lion  Heart. \n Parachute  bones  do  get  joined  at  least \n brother.   But  when  the  heart  breaks,  it  cannot  be  mended. \n I  too  had  fallen  head  over  heels  in  love  with  Chanda. \n We  were  about  to  get  married, \n right,  brother?   Before  marriage  she  used  to  say  that  she  wanted  to \n fly.   Went  paragliding.   The  rope \n broke.   The  donation  was  missed.   It  collided  with  the  mountain  and  broke. \n Bhai  Ji  Sher  Dil,  you  know \n your  name  does \n not  match  your  personality  at  all.   For  now, \n stop  crying,  you  [  __  ],  and  focus  on  the  mission.   And \n what  are  you  drinking?   Yes,  this  is  my  medicine. \n These  wounds  of  mine  are  very  deep. \n PM  has  made  medicine  for  this,  I  am  giving  him  lion  hearted  desi  medicine.   will \n you  do  it  once?   No, \n I  am  not  fond  of  drinking  urine.   I  know  Sher  Dil, \n your  life  played  games  with  you \n but  gave  you  nothing  in  return.   But  you \n can  gain  a  lot  by  playing  games  on  winso. \n what  is  winho  winho  brother? \n Vinso  is  a  number  one  gaming  app.   Where  there \n are  100  plus  games.   Such  as  Chess,  Ludo, \n Snake  and  Ladder.   In  all  these  you \n can  win  real  cash  by  playing.   Oh  no  brother, \n you  are  driving  me  crazy.   It  doesn't  happen  like  this. \n I  knew  you  wouldn't  believe  it. \n That's  why  I  have  also  brought  F  to  show  you  a  live \n demo.   Look  at  this.   I  opened \n Winso  and  I  am  playing  Ludo  game. \n And  this  is  what  I  won.   What's  the  matter  brother?   Yes. \n Now  the  winning  amount  will  be  transferred  to  my  account \n via  UPI.   Dekha  is  the  number  one \n trusted  app.   There  are  more  than  20  crore \n players.   So  if  you  join  Vinso  right  now, \n you  will  get  a  cashback  coupon  of  ₹500. \n So  stop  crying  and  add  money  only \n on \n Winzo.   Let  us  go.   Oh  brother,  what  have  you  done?   The  phone  was \n just  for  integration.   Rest  of  the  journey \n without  phone.   Hey  brother,  I  thought  I  would \n make  a  reel  wheel.   The  current  figures  are \n misleading.   The  present  is  an  illusion. \n Sher  Dil  and  I  have  been \n walking  on  these  roads  for  a  long  time,  braving  the  challenge  of  the  cold  winds. \n We  might  even  die  of  hypothermia. \n But  we  are  still  moving  ahead. \n Seeing  so  much  whiteness  everywhere  reminded  me  of  my \n youth  days.   Whenever  I  went  to  the  bathroom,  I  would \n come  back  after  whitewashing  all  the  walls  like  this. \n Heavy  squirt  attack  on  Sara  Ra, \n come  meet  me,  sew  it  you  bastards,  get  your  ass  [  __  ],  we  have  come  to  do \n all  this,  Sher  Dil,  we  have  to  find  the  yeti,  by  the  way,  Sher  Dil, \n \n how  intimately  do  you  know  this  place,  oh  brother  I  know  this \n place  as  intimately  as \n I  knew  every  mole  on  Chanda's  body,  there  was \n a  mole  on  her  armpit  too,  Bhai  Ji,  sometimes  I  used  to \n not  get  water  for  my  penis,  so  I  used  to  mix  the \n sweat  from  her  armpit  and  drink  it, \n what  a  thing,  the  pack  of  drinking  armpit  sweat  sounds \n very  tasty  and  nutritious. \n I  wish  we  could  get  such  nutritious  food. \n Otherwise  our  body  will  give  up  on  us  within  a  short  while. \n Oh  brother,  if  we  do \n not  ask  questions  to  the  body,  it  will  not  be \n able  to  answer.   Problem  solved  brother. \n Sher  Dil,  to  me  it  only  seemed  like  a  fool  to  me. \n But  today  after  listening  to  you, \n I  am  falling  in  love  with  your  face. \n Chanda  used  to  love  me.   Shut  up, \n lion  hearted  person.   Shut  up  and  go.    It  is \n not  ending.   We  can  get  lost  in  this  mess. \n And  if  by  mistake  we  lose  our  life \n then  our  dead  body  will  not  even  reach  our  home, \n friends,  because  there  is \n no  living  creature  here  for  miles.   Hello  brother. \n Brother,  are  you  shooting? \n Take  me  along  too,  friend.   Rest,  its  name  is  Moti \n and  this  is  Snow  Man.   Make  a  video  with  these  two. \n Just  for  ₹100.   Come  on.   Hey,  I  will  give \n you  a  discount,  come.   Hey  come  on  brother.   What \n brother, do \n  \n n't  you  say  brother,  I  am  stuck  in  the  snow  here  for  an  hour,  you  are \n \n ruining  my  script,  you  get  out \n of  here, \n as  I  said  friends,  there  is \n no  living  creature  here  for  miles,  so \n we  might  even  die. \n We  have  been  walking  on  these  icy  rocks  for  almost  seven  hours. \n Now  I  am \n feeling  very  thirsty  and  there \n is  no  trace  of  water  here,  friends. \n I  don't  want  to  die  of  dehydration.   So \n now  I  have  to  drink  my  urine. \n Here's  the  bottle  and  it's  time  to  drink. \n [MUSIC] \n Guys  my  fresh  pee  this  will  give  me  energy. \n  \n [MUSIC] \n Before  evening  Sher  Dil  and  I \n came  to  the  bottom  of  the  mountain  where  there  was  less  snow \n so  that  we  could  dig  a  shelter  for  the  night  on  dry  ground.   There  were \n many  breathtaking  sights  to  see  in  this  forest. \n I  have  to  hunt  for  dinner  and \n for  that  I  must  prepare  a  weapon. \n \n [Music] \n Oh  my \n God,  so  guys,  right  now  we  are  in  a  very  dense  forest \n and  we  have  to  be  prepared  at  every  moment \n because  we \n can  find  many  strange  animals  here.  Brother,  the  mole  is \n hiding  Rs.  100  under  this  tree, \n brother,  come  and  take  it. \n Nice,  so  brothers,  I  have  got  my  hidden  money \n back.   Nice. \n As  I  said,  a  very  strange \n animal.   But  the  special  thing  about  this  animal  is  that \n it  was  last  seen  in  the  jungles  of  Sonipat \n and  it  attacks  people's  brains  with  its  penis. \n That  means  it  is  your  forehead.   So \n be  careful  friends. \n The  sun  has  set,  friends,  and  we  haven't  found \n any  prey  yet.   I  hope \n this  black  one  will  definitely  be  useful.   Brother,  brother, \n I  was  searching  for  you  in  the  entire  forest  and  you  are \n standing  here  and  what  have  you  made  Dido?    Are \n you  mad,  Sher  Dil?   This  is  a  weapon.   With  this \n we  will  hunt  wild  animals  and \n kill  and  eat  them.   Oh  friend,  this  is  not  a  joke  anymore.   When  a \n wild  animal  is  hunted, \n it  requires  bait. \n Where  will  we  get  the  fodder  from  now? \n Do  I  think  you  are  so  stupid, \n Lion  Heart,  that  I  will  not  bring  the  bait.   Brother, \n you  have  brought  the  fodder.   Look  at  this  lion  heart. \n What's  the  matter,  what's  the  matter.   A  whole  hot \n plate.   This  Chicken  Tandoori  is  for  the  palak.   This \n carrot  halwa  is  for  the  rabbit  so  that  it  eats  it  and \n then  we  can  eat  it.   And  look  at  this  lion  heart \n hot  snake.   Nan  lion  hearted.   But  this  is  not  for  you. \n This  is  not  for  you.   This \n is  for  the  buffalo.   This  buffalo  will  eat  it,  then \n we  will  eat  it.   Got  it?   Brother,  small  mouth, \n big  talk,  if  I  eat  this  chicken,  have  you  gone \n mad,  Sher  Dil?   Brother  Ajay \n Devgan  has  arrived.   Have  you  gone  mad?   Lion \n heart,  this  is  food  for  hunting.   No,  don't \n look  at  it.   They  will  eat  the  prey  and  then  we  will \n eat  the  prey.   ok  wait.   Keep  this  spear  with  you \n so  that  if  any  bear  comes  to  attack  me,  you  can \n kill  it. \n [MUSIC] \n The  prey  must  be  coming.   He  must  be \n coming.   In  the  deep  darkness  of  the  night, \n Sher  Dil  and  I  were  stealthily  waiting  for  our  prey. \n \n But  our  luck  was  proving  to  be  quite  penis-less. \n \n Hunger  had  now  taken  over  Sher  Dil's  mind. \n Because  of  which  he  was  saying  very  strange  things. \n Oh  friend,  let  me  eat  chicken.   I'm  feeling  hungry, \n \n friend.   So  as  you  guys  can  see \n Sher  Dil's  mental  health  is  getting  worse. \n This  is  only  and  only \n because  of  hunger.   I  hope  we \n find  some  prey  soon  and  can  eat  something. \n Brother  what  is  this?   This  is  the  prey,  Sher  Dil,  come  and \n catch  him,  oy  friend  no  oy  oy  no  brother,  brother,  not  brother, \n oh  brother,  sorry  sorry  sorry  sorry,  don't \n panic,  don't  panic,  Sher  Dil, \n this  is  a  male,  oy  brother,  what  is  a  male,  he \n is  a  man,  and  brother,  what  were  you  doing  in  the  jungle  so  late  at  night, \n oy  friend,  now,  I  used  to \n live  in  the  upper  area  earlier,  but  when  I  saw  that  Yeti, \n I  had  to  come  down,  brother,  and  brother, \n my  house  downstairs  is  completely  mud-built, \n there  is  no  place  to  defecate, \n so  I  came  to  the  forest  to  defecate. \n Look  there,  I  have  pooped  there. \n What  did  you  come  there  to  do?    Washroom.   Do \n you  understand  what  this  means,  six  days?   What  do  you \n mean?   This  means  that  our  food  has  been  arranged.   Just \n imagine,  if  animal  feces  are  so \n tasty  then  human  feces  would  be  even  more \n tasty.   Brother,  what  are  you  talking  about \n ?   Come  on  lion  heart.   Come  on,  there  is  no  time.   It \n will  cool  down.   What  is  it?   Are  you  crazy? \n Found  it.   Here  it  is.   Finally.   Oh  friend  what's  the  matter. \n Brother,  yuck  brother,  I  will  eat  it  to  the  fullest.    I  will \n not  leave  anything.   I  leave  a  little  bit \n \n for  the  lion  hearted  one.   Very  shy.   Did  you  eat  rajma \n ?   What  is  the  matter.   There  is  just  a  little  bit  left.   You \n can  eat  it  too.   All  the  best.    The \n temperature  can  drop  quite  a  bit  at  night  which  requires \n me  to  pick  up  some  wood  and  try  to  make  a  fire  with  it. \n \n \n Why  can't  you  take  this  for  a  minute \n ?   Hey  your  father,  because  of  your  mistake \n Amitabh  ji  came.   After  the  fire,  we  were  ready,  having  pitched  a  sturdy  tent. \n \n So  we  have  just  found  this  one  and  a  half  year  old \n tree  and  we  will  remove  its  dead  skin \n because  in  old  times  people  used  to \n eat  it  as  breakfast.   It  is  also  called  nature's  nest. \n So  let's  taste  it. \n Its  taste  is  quite  bad.   Yuck.   Right  now \n Sher  Dil  has  gone  to  the  pond  to  fetch  water.   I \n hope  no  leopard \n eats  him  and  he  returns  safely  to  Sher  Dil. \n Brother,  I  brought  fresh  water, \n that  was  all  I  got  from  the  pond  there. \n No  problem,  Sher  Dil  is  a  very  good  thing.    It \n looks  exactly  like  Aqua  Guard  water.   So \n friends,  we  will  decide  the  rest  of  the  journey  tomorrow.   We \n will  do  it  tomorrow,  brother.   We  will  have  a  party  today. \n So  today  we  have  to  spend  this  night  in  this  rugged  forest \n and  we \n set  up  our  tent  on  the  bank  of  the  pond.   I  have  brought \n Bhai  Ji  to  the  sexy  sexy  forest, \n get  behind  me,  lion  heart,  you  have  drunk  too  much. \n Give  it  back,  give  it  back.   No, \n you  go  to  sleep.   No  brother,  I  will  not  leave  you. \n Lion  hearted  egg  market  shandi  brother \n ji.   Good  night.   What  does  he  keep  drinking?   Your \n mobile.   Let  me  also  taste  it  today. \n Wow  wow  this  tastes  exactly  like  my  urine. \n Lion,  you  also  drink  urine  every  day, \n then  why  do  you  stop  me?   So \n friends,  the  temperature  has  dropped  a  lot.   It  will \n be  around  -15  degrees  Celsius.   Now  to \n survive  we  have  kept  the  fire  burning.   Let's \n see  now.   I,  the  lion-hearted  one,  have \n set  that  fire.   What  happened?   Why  are \n you  shouting?   Brother,  I  am  burning  up.   Lion  heart,  you  have  been  jealous  ever  since  you \n met  me.   No  problem, \n one  day  you  too  will  be  successful.   You \n will  become  a  survivor  like  me.   A  real  Sir  Bhai  Sher  Dil \n got  fire.   Where  do  I  get  [  __  ]  water?    The \n pond  is  quite  far  away. \n We  will  save  the  lion  hearted  person  with  this  water.   Come \n on.   I  am  tired.   One  minute  one  minute  lion  heart. \n O  my  ja \n Chulab  saved  Sher  Dil. \n Sher  Dil  must  have  learnt  from  today's  incident  that  when  a \n boil  appears  on  the  ass,  it  is \n better  to  use  your  own  hands  rather  than  waiting  for  someone  else's  hands  to  apply  ointment. \n \n Well  all  I'm  thinking  is  if  this  night \n went  like  this  then  what  will  tomorrow \n  \n be  like  [music].   With  the  first  rays  of  the  morning,  Sher  Dil \n and  I  had  to  bid  goodbye  to  these  lower  forests  and  move  towards  the \n upper  mountains.   So  without  wasting  any  time \n we  proceeded  further  and  in  the \n blink  of  an  eye  we  reached  the  snow  covered  upper \n forests. \n We  will  have  to  cross  this  ice  rock. \n Lion  heart,  lion  heart,  don't  talk  nonsense.   Oh  man  I  was  just  having  a \n bit  of  fun.   come  soon.   Brother,  let  me \n tell  you  one  thing,  if  my  Chanda  was  alive  today,  she  would  have \n felt  very  proud  of  me.   Do  you  know \n why?   Why?   You \n also  did  that  adventure  with  Ranveer  Singh,  right?   Yes.   And  today \n I  did  it  with  you  too.   So  both  of  us  are \n in  the  same  list,  right?   And  Ranveer  Singh  was \n his  favorite  actor.   Bhai  Ji,  I  had \n a  request  from  you.   After  this  mission  is  over,  please  get \n a  photo  of  me  with  Ranveer  Singh. \n I  don't  talk  to  him.   why  brother \n ?   Last  time  I  took  him  to  a  big  snow  covered \n mountain.   Seeing  it  he  says,  wow, \n so  many  cuckoos,  it  is  a  very  strange  creature. \n No  no  come  on.   The  lion  hearted  person  came  to  his  senses. \n What  is  this? \n Whose  paw  prints  are  these,  Sher  Dil?   Brother, \n I  think  it  is  a  wild  bear  or \n some  other  thing, \n come  carefully,  lion  hearted,  do  not  make  any  noise, \n but  brother,  why  did  it  come  so  low \n ?   I  don't  know,  come  come  come  come,  be  careful,  he  does \n n't  like  noise  at  all.   Brother, \n you  are  the  one  sounding  crazy.   Don't  argue  with  me, \n Lion  Heart.   These  people  are  very  peaceful \n \n [music]. \n Sisterfucker  what  kind  of  movie  is  this?   Come  on \n brother,  let's  see  it.   Be  careful  while  singing. \n Oh  yes  brother  Pradhan,  who  are  you?   Oh  brother, \n this  looks  like  a  chicken  thief. \n Oh  my  friend,  this  is  not  mischief  but  I  also  have  a  strong  will \n brother.   o  who  are  you?   O  one  minute  O \n police  O  police  has  come  O  sir  sorry  sir  I  will \n not  do  it  next  time  sir  please  forgive  me.   No  no  no, \n we  are  not  the  police.   My  name  is  Bear \n Grylls  and  I'm  out  in  search  of  the  Yeti. \n Oh  so  you  are  this  party  oh  yes  I  am  the \n Yeti.   Oh  brother,  he  is  lying.   This \n is  not  a  Yeti.

Oh  yes \n brother,  he  takes  the  ganja  from  us  only. \n You  did  not  listen  to  his  nonsense. \n what  does  he  say?   He  says  that  India  will \n lose  to  Pakistan  in  cricket.   Tell  me,  can \n any  sane  person  say  such  things? \n What  is  needed  for  that?   Top  addiction. \n Who  gives  top  intoxication?   This  was  myself.   And  now  they  are \n telling  us  that  we  are  not  honest.   You \n are  lying.   One  minute.   I'm  really  sorry \n for  that.   That's  my  intention.

Two  drunkards  and  a  drunkard. \n O  Chanda  O  sorry  unfaithful  Chanda  O  you  had  said  that \n you  want  to  fly  before  marriage.   I \n thought  you  had  to  go  paragliding  and \n from  there  you  reached  straight  to  God. \n And  but  why  are  you  roaming  here  like  a  cartoon  with  Malchi? \n yes  so  what  lie  did  you \n tell?   I  just  had  to  fly.   Ever  since  I \n met  Yeti,  I  fly  every  day  without  a  fan. \n Not  like  you,  he  used  to  make  me  drink  water  and  then \n throw  me  in  the  drains.   Yeti  brings  Malana  Cream. \n Pure  Manala  Cream  Baby.   Yes. \n Before  whatever  little  respect  you  have  left  gets \n washed  away  in  the  stream  of  urine.   You  come  with  me,  Lion \n Heart.   We  have  to  find  our  Yeti.   Come  on. \n Oh,  did  you  want  to  see  this  Yeti  from  the  mountains? \n Hey  brother,  you  should  have  told  me  earlier.   Oh,  he  will  eat  one  and \n you  will  see  three  Yetis.   If  one  eats  two  then  he  will  see  10  yotis. \n And  in  all  the  food,  you  will  become  a  saint,  brother. \n Oh,  try  eating  it. \n Before  this  man  crushes  my  brain  thinking  it  to  be  marijuana. \n We  have  to  leave. \n Come  quickly,  Lion  Heart.   Oh  brother  I  am  very  sorry.   O \n brother,  please  forgive  me  but  I  will \n not  be  able  to  come  forward  with  you.   And  I \n want  revenge  for  my  love,  brother.   I  will \n go  to  the  village  with  my  money.   Chanda,  come  on.   oh  this \n is  my  moon   Oh  this  is  my  Chanda.   Leave  it.    It \n 's  my  moon.   Leave  it. \n Someone  has  said  it  right,  friends.   The \n ladder  of  stupidity  ends  only  on  the  roof  of  love. \n So  leaving  the  drug  addicts'  screening  of  Hum  Dil  De \n Chuke  Sanam,  I  set  out  on  my \n desperate \n search  for  my  destination  where  I  saw  a  golden  fly \n and  I  think  it's  dead  but \n I  still  can't  use  my  hands. \n If  it  is  alive,  its  poison \n can  be  very  toxic.   Dear \n fly,  come  here  for  a  minute.   She  is  dead.   She  is  dead, \n friends. \n My  breakfast  was  arranged. \n [MUSIC] \n Oh  little  snake  calm  down  calm  down \n this  is  so  beautiful.   I  won't  eat  it. \n I  leave  it.   You  go  and  come. \n  \n [MUSIC] \n So  we've  reached  the  cave  on  the  southern  mountain. \n And \n any  proof  or  clue  of  the  existence  of  Yeti,  wait  a \n minute  this  proof  is  not  the  proof  of  Yeti.   This \n means  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  Yeti, \n friends,  because  I  have  searched  the  entire  mountain \n and  Yeti  is  just  a  man-made \n imagination.   No  such  thing  exists. \n \n Friends,  I  have  been  successful  in  another  mission.   Thank  you  so  much. \n We'll  meet  up  soon  in  the  next  episode  and  look  for  some  new  creatures. \n So  see  you  friends.   Go  ahead \n sorry  sir  no  this  is  this  sorry  hey  someone \n save  me  please  please \n share  tell  me  bhaiya  ji \n [music] \n whom  do  you  ask  before  writing  this?   To  be \n continued.   Are?   I  will  tell  you  in  the  next  episode.    The \n web  show  is  on-going.   Tell  me  in  this.   You  will \n find  out  in  this  episode.   I  don't  know. \n \n Tell  me  in  this  episode.   Sorry  brother. \n You  were  going  to  kill  me  the  sixth  day. \n Oh  no  brother  I  will  kill  you. \n Why?   You  are  my  brother,  right?   I  would  have \n just  scared  you  a  bit  and  then  left  you.   But \n how  come  there  is  so  much  pomp  and  show?   Brother,  that  is \n Singh  Tailor's  shop  on  Mall  Road.   He \n is  a  very  good  tailor.   It  has  given  a  very  nice  peel. \n Look  at  the  peel,  I  am  asking  you \n what  is  this  plan?   Why  are  you  roaming  around  like  a  Yeti \n ?   That  is  for  the  family,  brother. \n What  kind  of  family?   Brother,  what  should  I  tell  you? \n You  people  come  here  and \n build  your  buildings.   You  cut  down  all  our  trees  and  plants. \n Right  now,  I  am  not  a  very  knowledgeable \n person.   I  don't  know  about \n global  warming,  climate  change, \n I  don't  know  about  all  this.   I  only  know \n that  I  have  lived  with  these  trees  and  plants  since  my  childhood. \n They  are  like  my  family. \n I  can't  see  them  being  cut  any  more. \n This  theme  park  project  of  yours  was  about  to \n start,  this  entire  area  was  about  to  be  cut  down, \n people  were  about  to  cut  down  all  the  trees  and  plants,  so \n whatever  came  to  my  mind  I  did,  I \n roamed  around  as  a  Yeti,  scared  people,  drove  them  away  and \n saved  my  family,  tell  me  what  wrong  did  I  do, \n rest  Bhai  Ji,  if  you  find  my  mistake,  then \n put  me  in  jail,  no  problem,  I \n saved  the  family  Bhai  Ji \n [Music] \n Sir  Sir  Sir  Sir  I  had  a  question,  so  Bear  Sir,  did \n you  find  the  Yeti?   Yes,  I \n saw  Yeti,  he  was  very  ferocious  and  dangerous. \n As  soon  as  he  saw  me  he  started  following  me.   I  am \n thankful  to  God  that  my \n life  was  saved.   Otherwise  I  would  not  have  been  sitting  in  front  of  you  today. \n My  request  to  everyone  is \n that  this  theme  park  project  should  be  stopped  as  soon  as \n possible,  otherwise  everything  will  be  destroyed  by  Yeti's  wrath. \n \n [MUSIC] \n [MUSIC] \n Thank  you  so  much  guys  for  watching  my \n video.
