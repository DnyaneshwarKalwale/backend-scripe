  "transcript": "a  anyways  the  brand  I  wouldn't  work  with \n again  I  suck  freely  on  that  sounds \n really  bad  I  would  never  collab  with \n that  guy  ever  again  did  you  see  my  feet \n tweet  feet  I'm  disassociated  I  actually \n once  took  a  medicated  drug  that  is  not \n legal  damn  you  too  how  was  ketamine \n she's  kissed  another  stream  wait  oh  I've \n kissed  hi  everybody  welcome  back  today \n we're  doing  doing  a  video  concept  that \n was  initially  titled  spill  your  guts  or \n fill  your  guts  but  I  think  that  sounds \n kind  of  weird  so  the  name  is  up  I'm \n really  glad  you're  not  doing  fill  your \n guts  that's  you  know  what  I  so  basically \n the  premise  is  we  have  five  tiers  of \n strange  foods  and  they  kind  of  get \n stranger  as  the  tear  go  on  and  so  all \n the  questions  that  we  have  to  answer \n otherwise  we  need  to  eat  them  what  tear \n is  zebra  tarantula  sardines  and  tomato \n sauce  durian  and  doesn't  that  don't \n sound  that  bad  preserve  duck  egg  okay  no \n but  smell \n it  I  didn't  think  you  knew  what  you  were \n getting  yourself  into  and  now  I  know  you \n don't  know  what  you're  getting  yourself \n well  you  just  asked  me  to  do  stuff  I \n just  said  yes  cuz  I'm  like  Pokey  asked \n me  to  do  something  I'll  do  anything  with \n you  except  like  kiss \n you  literally  that  is  the  my  my  limit  I \n cannot  I  just  I  can't  I  just  I  don't \n want  I'm  sorry  all  right  question  one \n who  is  your  favorite  streamer  besides \n yourself  this  is  the  only  easy  one  I \n would  say  my  favorite  streamer  is  Lily \n Pichu  like  I  just  love  her  so  much  I \n think  she's  so  funny  and  I  like  her \n aesthetic  and  I  think  she's  just  so \n admirable  and  I  think  she's  so  answer \n you  can't  we  can't  say  each  other  my \n actual  answers  well  what  the  what  do  you \n mean  your  actual  answer  R  ly  R  Lily  my \n actual  answer  my  actual \n are  you  know  I  was  saying  like  actually \n it \n is  okay  what  what  is  it  for  you  I  would \n say  the  four  people  I  watch  the  most  oh \n wow  Janet  Josh  Arya  Lily  are  the  four \n that  I  watch  the  most  and  it's  such \n terrible  answers  cuz  they're  just  like \n four  of  my  closest  friends  literally \n well  I  just  got  back  on  Twitch  so  I've \n been  browsing \n the  and  The  Crowd  Goes  what  wait  I \n thought  you  loved  YouTube  I  did  actually \n you  should  go  back  to  our  last  video \n remember  how  much  you  were  talking  up \n YouTube  you  know  what  YouTube  is  better \n than  twitch  as  a  streaming \n platform  how  much  are  they  paying  you  to \n say  that  a \n lot  I  appreciate  the  honesty  yeah  let  me \n I  want \n more  cuz  they're  paying  you \n more  crazy  I  love  YouTube  and  everything \n that \n YouTube  has  done  for  me  um  including  My \n Everything  YouTube  has  done  for  me \n my  bank  account  more  we  love  you  my  net \n worth  and  my  home  my  cars  my  watches  my \n [ __ ]  my \n hose  it's  like  I  came  back  to  my  ex  you \n know  TCH  you  know  after  like  2  years  I'm \n like  hey  babe  I  actually  kind  of  miss \n you  yeah  I  missed  you  so  much  I'm  coming \n back  when  I  left  I  like  unfollowed \n everyone  wait  really  yeah  what  I  don't \n know  just  felt  like  it  was  a  clean  break \n you  know  you  were  like  I'm  done  with \n this  yeah  and  then  you  came  back  not \n following  anyone  right  now  so  now  it's \n like  recommended  channels  and  everything \n only  so  I  have  to  like  do  it  so  I \n haven't  really  been  watching  streams \n that's  my  I  don't  I  don't  have  any \n answer  who  is  your  most  embarrassing \n moment  on  stream  I  can  think  of  too \n many  embarrassing  moment  I  have  a \n standout  though  so  this  one  time  I  was \n minding  my  business  being  the \n Civilized  respectful  streamer  that  I  am \n and  someone  sent  me  a  link  and  they  were \n basically  like  oh  I  made  fan  art  of  you \n they  said  really  nice  and  the  link \n looked  normal  you  clicked  on  the  link  I \n clicked  on  the  link  what  was  it  a \n penis \n boo  it  was  an  inappropriate  link  and  the \n thing  is  it  popped  up  on  my  main  monitor \n that  I'm  streaming  and  not  on  the  side \n one  but  the  upside  to  that  really \n embarrassing  moment  is  it  kind  of  turned \n into  a  meme  like  people  instead  of  the \n pH  people  would  put  anything  cuz  my \n reaction  was  just  screaming  really \n loudly  so  they  would  put  like  someone's \n face  popping  up  that  be  like  ah \n so  what's  yours  I  thought  I  ended  stream \n oh  I  like  changed  the  scene  to  like \n ending  screen  I  didn't  meet  my  mic  I \n think  oh  you  just  started  farting  up  a \n storm  now  I  remember  I  was  raiding \n someone  and  then  and  it  doesn't  end  it \n doesn't  end  and  I  didn't  know  that  so  I \n was  like  talking  to  myself  I'm  like  yeah \n I  think  I  did  pretty  good  today  how  many \n how  many  oh  my  God  I  got  this  many  oh \n you  did  pretty  good  yeah  I'm  out  loud \n yes  you  just  speak  to  yourself  out  loud \n I  think  someone  on  like  my  friend  or \n something  was  there  it  was  one  other \n person  there  of  cute  I'm  like  I  don't \n usually  do  that  though  I'm  like  yeah  but \n that  particular  day  I  felt  like  patting \n myself  yeah  dude  I  killed  it  today  yeah \n I'm  like  it's  so  and  then  they  were  like \n they  sound  like  an  anime  character  and \n like  Li  you  know  we  can  hear \n you  but  I'm  so  glad  like  at  least  it's \n like  that  and  not  like  farted  or  like \n something  you  know  I  took  a  [ __ ]  farting \n would  have  been  amazing  that  would  have \n been  really  funny  too  like  liy  fart \n compation  I  don't  like  those  words \n together  like  you  shouldn't  say  that  I \n like  them  question \n three  ever  ghosted  someone  what  happen \n I've  ever  ghosted  someone  are  you \n opening  it  she  just  started  opening  it \n okay  I  actually  have  never  ghosted \n someone  but  you're  but  I  wanted  to  open \n this  just  to  see  what  it  was \n like  they  actually  smell  really  good  no \n I  bet  it  it's  not  that  bad  just  smell  I \n just  don't  like  bugs  yeah  can  you  just \n smell  them  if  I  see  a  tiny  bug  I  freak \n out  close  your  eyes  no  close  your  eyes \n and  hold  my  hand  and  I'll  just  smell  it \n it's  hey  oh  it  smells  like  chips  yeah  oh \n I  just  don't  like  bugs  honestly  I've \n never  ghosted  anyone  I  don't  even  meet \n that  many  people  like  honestly  I  wish  I \n had  more  opportunities  to  ghost  I  ghost \n to  someone  it  was  like  one  of  those \n moments  where  like  I  was  put  on  the  spot \n and  the  fan  was  like  please  add  me  on \n this  Instagram  or  disc  count  oh  that's \n when  I  ghosted  them  though  I'm  thinking \n ghosting  like  relationship  ghosting  just \n like  someone  you're  involved  with  and \n you  like  stop  answering  them  instead  of \n having  a  conversation  about  closure  M \n yes  but  it  was  mostly  dated  like  okay  I \n haven't  spoken  to  them  in  like  5  months \n if  I  responded  now  oh  my  God  it's  going \n to  be  so  bad  so  I'm  just  going  to  put  it \n off  even  more  more  does  that  make  sense \n like  I  know  it  was  really  you  guys \n didn't  speak  for  5  months  who  initiated \n that  ghosting  I  forgot  to  respond  to  one \n thing  and  then  it  piled  up  and  then  it's \n like  it  became  like  oh  you \n accidentally  I  cannot  message  again  cuz \n now  I'm  embarrassed  and  I'm  like  a  [ __ ] \n [ __ ]  [ __ ]  fa  that's  like  the  sweetest \n ghosting  story  no  it's  not  it's  pretty \n bad  I  felt  bad  yeah  but  if  you're  going \n to  ghost  at  least  it  was  accidental  you \n know  it  just  like  piles  up  man  if  it's \n just  like  not  answering  someone  I've \n ghosted  so  so  many  people  I'm  ghosting  a \n streamer  right  now  but  I've  never  went \n on  a  date  with  them  kind  of  thing  so \n it's  like  not  I'll  show  you  later  okay  F \n five  are  you  jealous  no  oh  that  was  kind \n of  defensive  for  someone  who's  not \n jealous  I'm  not  jealous  I'm  just  an \n empath  I  don't  even  know  like  I  just  say \n that  because  I  heard  lwig  say  it  once \n and  it  just  sounded  so  ridiculous  should \n we  try  one  though  you  should  try  one  you \n seem  like  you  really  want  to  try  one  it \n genuinely  smells  good \n how  does  it \n taste  it's  like  uh  toaster  cereal  yeah \n it's  like  a  these  are  like  so  dried  but \n if  you  ate  a  whole  one  it  would  be \n really  yuck  cuz  then  you  could  feel \n every  part  of  the  bug  that  you're  biting \n into  all  right  question  one  have  you \n ever  pretended  to  like  a  game  you \n actually  hate \n it \n yes  yeah  no  yeah  so  many  times \n if  any  sponsors  are  listening  we  never \n ever  do \n this  now  stop  listening  that's  what  just \n say  it  has  to  be  sponsored  I  mean \n luckily  I  haven't  done  this  in  a  really \n long  time  but  like  years  ago  when  I  was \n like  first  getting  sponsors  and  stuff \n there  were  times  where  like  they \n wouldn't  even  let  you  try  the  game \n beforehand  and  it  would  not  be  that \n wellb  built  out  and  you  would  just  be \n like  I'm  having  such  a  good  time  we're \n still  very  lucky  to  be  be  able  to  get \n sponsors  like  that  aside  from  that  I \n think  actually  has  there  ever  been  a \n time  where  like  you're  playing  with \n other  people  and  it  just  stops  being  fun \n um  yes  hold  on  hold  on  let  me  think \n about  this \n [Music] \n though  girl  I've  played  some  Among  Us \n games  that  stopped  being  fun  and  you \n guys  can  tell  when  I'm  not  having  fun \n anymore  actually  I'm  outing  you  right \n now  one  time  Lily  was  invited  to  a  Lobby \n that  I  wasn't  invited  to  and  halfway \n through  she  was  like  I'm  really  not \n having  a  good  time  I'm  leaving  oh  yeah \n yeah  yeah  sometimes  like  a  long  break  is \n what  you  need  too  from  that  game  like \n League  of  Legends  I've  taking  a  long \n break  I'm  ready  to  go  back  no  that's \n what  I  want  to  go  back  everyone  comes \n back  eventually  should  we  make  a \n everyone  comes  back  eventually  don't \n [ __ ]  leave  League  of  Legends  who \n wants  mid  lane  we  can  s  turns  playing \n mid  lane  you  can  play  Lux  one  game  and \n I'll  play  Lux  the  next  game  okay

once  you  come  back  after  a  long \n time  it's  it's  kind  of  it's  so  fun  it's \n fun  again  it's  something  all  right  it's \n fun  have  you  seen  the  new  bunny  girl  M \n anyways  can  we  go  to  the  next  question \n what  is  your  biggest  pet  peeve  in  The \n Gaming \n Community  my  biggest  pet  peeve  in  The \n Gaming  Community  my  biggest  pet  peeve  in \n The  Gaming  Community \n is \n misog  it's  all  the  big  Tre  misogyny \n homophobia  transphobia  my  other  pet \n peeve  when  people  who  are  literally \n quarter  of  my  ELO  and  skill  level  try  to \n freaking  backseat  me  me \n me  me  oh  my  pet  peeve  is  when  they  come \n into  my  chat  and  they're  like  she's \n she's  trolling  right  she  like  no  one's \n this  bad  like  intentionally  like  she  and \n I  have  to  tell  them  like  no  this  is  me \n I'm  not  trolling  for  I'm  not  making  this \n up  for  this  is  me  they're  like  she's \n just  pring  to  be  like  dumb  gamer  girl \n really  no  one's  really  this  bad  at  games \n I'm  like  no  I  am  this  bad  I  felt  a  lot \n better  one  day  when  I  went  to  watch  a \n professional  football  soccer  football \n match  and  I  saw  like  legit  respectfully \n guys  who  were  like  geriatric  yelling  at \n the  guys  on  the  field  being  like  why \n don't  you \n shoot  and  it's  like  sir  you're  80  you \n can't  even  kick  a  ball  you  think  you \n know  more  than  the  guy  who's  on  the \n field  right  now  is  getting  paid  Millions \n to  play  this  match  right  now  but  you \n know  what  I  mean  so  like  is  it  I  mean \n you  know  what  I  mean  no  I  get  it \n remember  old  people  old  people  I'm  going \n to  read  one  die  what \n the \n [ __ ]  yes  she  said  she  doesn't  mean  that \n that's  what  I  thought  they  were  going  to \n say  that  wasn't  what  I  was  say  she  meant \n that  you  and  I  would  both  have  to  die \n first  oh  no  she  just  flat  out  said  [ __ ] \n old  people  in  my  video  old  people  should \n die  there's  been  a  lot  of  times  where \n I'm  like  I  suck  freely  on  that  sounds \n really  bad  I  suck  at  games  suck  freely \n on  what  I  suck  atam  fart  compilation \n Lily  sucks  fre  I  suck  at  games \n freely  on  my  stream  okay  so  say  when \n people  are  like  they  think  I'm  faking  it \n for  Content  I'm  like  I'm  really  not  like \n this  is  just  who  I  am  and  you  have  to \n accept  it  and  then  the  comments  change \n from  that  to  I  watch  Lily  because  it \n makes  me  feel  better  about  myself  and \n I'm  like  there  you  go  that's  really  cute \n I  like  that  you're  right  what  is  a  brand \n you  wouldn't  work  with  again  and \n why  you  want  to  open \n it  let's  just  open  it  for  fun  you  want \n me  to  open  it  for  fun  I  so  want  to  say \n the  brand  I  could  say  the  why  but  but \n does  that  count  you  have  to  say  the \n brand  I'm  going  to  open  it  fine  cuz  like \n I  also  have  something  too  but  what  if \n like  one  day  you  want  to  like  work  again \n I  know  I  don't  like  let's  just  say  the \n wies  while  we  eat  oh  smells  really \n pungent  wait  that  smells  good  why  so  why \n wouldn't  you  work  with  that  brand  again \n hey  Daniel  what  brand  wouldn't  we  work \n with  again  there  were  a  bunch  where  we \n were  like  n  [ __ ]  these  people  remember  I \n have  said  this  before  remember  one  that \n LE  said  [ __ ]  these  people  yeah  what \n brand  did  you  r  two  that's  what  I  mean \n like  there's  tomb  men  oh  but  that's  like \n and  then  sometimes  the  content  most  of \n just  content  bag  not  like  the  Branded \n bad \n 2022  year  there  were  some  Hold  Up  Wait \n I'm  going  to  I'm  going  to  eat  it  wait \n this  is  so  yum  that  should  have  been \n first  yeah  I  think  so  too  actually  this \n is  just  fish  and  tomato  sa  you  know \n we're  still  getting  started  anyways  the \n brand  I  wouldn't  work  with \n again  do  not  work  with  them  and  the \n reason  I  can't  say  it  is  because  they're \n part  of  like  such  a  larger  conglomerate \n but  oh  my  god  when  I  worked  with  them \n every  sing  thing  I  would  send  in  they \n would  have  the  smallest  nit  pickiest \n thing  and  reason  to  like  reject  the \n material  they'  be  like  M  there's  a \n slight  glare  there  m  you're  wearing \n white  and  there's  white  on  the  packaging \n so  we  can't  accept  that  wow  Leah  legit  I \n had  to  redo  the  same  thing  like  five \n times  for  reasons  that  are  so  irrelevant \n and  it  sucks  cuz  when  you  have  a  really \n funny  or  good  idea  and  then  they  take \n away  the  funniness  and  good  idea  by \n making  it  like  too  perfect  or  weird  it \n just  sucked  and  then  the  literal  second \n that  I  had  any  sort  of  controversy  they \n dropped  me  like  and  they  were  like \n delete \n everything  I  mean  I  can't  be  surprised \n it's  their  prerogative  but  that's  crazy \n they  were  cookie  beans  I've  had \n instances  too  where  it's  like  you  want \n to  be  creative  with  it  you  want  to \n insert  your  own  like  personality  into  it \n mhm  but  they  make  more  and  more  like  no \n we  don't  like  this  no  change  this  no \n this  like  it  gets  more  and  more  corpo  do \n you  want  engagement  or  no  do  you  want \n bang  for  your  buck  or  no  like  you  hire \n these  content  creators  because  you  think \n they  can  like  advertise  your  brand  using \n cuz  like  you  know  influence  you  know \n influence  or  whatever  but  you  take  away \n everything  that  makes  us  and  you  just  do \n what  you  want  to  do  it's  like  why  at \n this  point  just  hire  a  model  to  do  your \n ad  why  me  look  why  Pokey  why  me  all \n right  question  one \n have  you  ever  broken  the \n law  oh  once  I  did  weed  and  weed's  legal \n that  wasn't \n legal  I'm  such  a  bad  law  breaker  please \n don't  know  oh  my  naughty  Discord  kitten \n I'm  sorry  wait  you  said  you  did  weed  in \n what  a  state  that  where  it  wasn't  oh  in \n a  state  where  it  wasn't  legal  yes  I \n broke  lots  of  laws  the  most  I  broke  so \n many  laws  I've  have  jaywalked  oh  Mimi \n you  want  gole  juice  okay  sorry  you  can \n have  it  Mimi  wants  to  be  left  alone  what \n is  she  oh  I  think  she  smells  the  durian \n oh  or  the  fish  the \n fish  she  definitely  smells  the  fish  oh \n she  does  not  like  that  I  think  it's  this \n really  you  like \n this  oh  she  likes  she  likes  the  fish  she \n likes  the  fish  that's  cute  okay  I \n actually  once  took \n a  medicated  drug  that  is  not  legal  it \n was  a  doctor  who  gave  it  to  me  so  damn \n you  too  how  was  ketamine  no  not  that \n cookie  beans  actually  I  feel  like  if  a \n doctor  gives  you  ketamine  it's  probably \n a  legal  dose  yeah  but  I  was  sick  and  I \n needed \n it  you  know  I'm  just  going  to  have  a \n bite  what  if  I  didn't  break  anymore  like \n I  don't  I  don't  care  think  anything  but \n I  I  just  want  to  try  it \n [Music] \n anyway  okay  it  doesn't  have  that  peach \n taste  anymore  when  I  had  it  long  ago  it \n tasted  like  back  in  my  days  she's  being \n so  nice  she  doesn't  want  anyone  to  get \n mad  at  her  but  like  just  be  honest  it's \n not  bad  I'm  not  like  it's  okay  I'll  tell \n you  guys  the  truth  no  no  it's  really  not \n bad  but  it's  not  good  either  I'm  sorry \n to  all  the  durian  lovers  I  love  you  too \n but  if  it  ain't  my  style  it's  just  to  me \n I  don't  I  don't  I  don't  hate  it  I  don't \n love  it  it's  just  I  wouldn't  go  out  of \n my  way  to  get  it  again  that  is  hard  to \n inhale  that's  like  a  Savory  taste  to  it \n I  don't  know  like  it's  so  different  from \n the  duing  I  had  and  why  am  I  eating  this \n I  answered  you  don't  have  to  eat  it  put \n it  back  I'm  so  curious  but  there's  more \n questions  yeah  I  I'll  literally  eat  like \n the  whole \n thing  actually  should  you  get  myself  try \n it  it's  so  good  oh  my  godan  poke  I  don't \n know  if  I  can  swallow  that  Pokey  the  one \n I  had  was  like  I  swear  it  tasted  better \n than  that  one  oh  Daniel  wants  a  try  too \n I  got  this  small  out  I  actually  cannot \n swallow  it  how  is  it  Daniel  like  it  he \n doesn't \n like  oh  that's  there  there  he  goes \n That's  my \n brother \n right  pent  it's  it's  very  pungent  I  can \n imagine  a  world  where  like  you  get  to  a \n point  that  you  really  like  it  like  when \n you  have  that  acquired  taste  but  I'm  not \n there  yet  I'm  like  sensitive  you  know \n what  I  think  it  was  I  think  I  had  a  Duan \n flavored  dessert  back  then  and  no  wonder \n it  tasted  pretty  good  maybe  that's  why \n it  tastes  so  different  from  what  I \n remember  have  you  ever  cheated  in  a  game \n to  win  no  most  of  the  games  I  play  like \n you  can't  cheat  you  cheat  yeah  exactly \n you  can't  cheat  in  League  or  like  Aimbot \n in  valorant  have  you  ever  cheated  in \n like  test  school  or  anything  like  that \n the  only  time  I  really  cheated  on \n something  was  in  second  grade  I  will \n admit  I  cheated  on  a  test  uhhuh  I  liked \n my  teacher  so  much  and  I  felt  so  bad \n that  I  confessed  you're  such  a  piure  and \n she \n laughed  she  was  probably  you  she  was \n like  you're  so  silly  you're  like  like  I \n got  away  with  it  and  I  still  confessed \n she  probably  thought  it  was  a  cute  and \n in  hindsight  that  is  kind  of  cute  okay \n so  in  college  I  had  a  oh  College  I  had \n to  take  an  anatomy  class  because  I  had \n to  sign  it  was  if  you  need  an  anatomy \n class  just  let  me  know \n I'll  [ __ ]  bite  you  please  my  little \n Discord  invites  that's  crazy  um  actually \n Michael  does  that  really  well  um \n actually  um  actually  like  that  oh  my  God \n you  know  like  the  girls  on  Tik  Tok  and \n do \n that  he  practices  in  the  mirror  dude  I \n swear  he's  such  a  natural  he's  so  good \n at  it  um  actually  in  college  I  had  to \n cheat  once  um  I  took  an  intro  to \n physical  Anatomy  whatever  class  because \n it  was  the  only  science  selective  I \n could  take  because  everything  else  was \n taken  and  I  had  no  choice  I  had  to  take \n one  s  selective  and  I  don't  know  any \n [ __ ]  about  Anatomy  okay  like  it's  like \n it's  like  so  far  I'm  like  measuring  in \n music  and  I  had  to  take  an  anatomy  class \n and  then  like  the  teacher  didn't  really \n give  a  [ __ ]  he  just  gave  like  a \n PowerPoint  and  it  was  just  memorize \n everything  on  the  PowerPoint  and  take \n the  test  so  I  noticed  every  single  class \n he  just  sat  there  like  doing  this  while \n we  took  the  test  oh  so  it  was  easy  to \n cheat  typ  every  [ __ ]  student  would \n like  get  their  phone  here  and  just  yeah \n I  did  study  and  I  did  try  for  the  first \n 95%  but  the  final  exam  I'm  like  damn  I  I \n don't  I  just  want  to  pass  so  I  did  I  got \n out  my  phone  T  cuz  everyone  was  doing  it \n but  this  final  exam  day  the  teacher  was \n paying  ATT  10  yes  no  he  stood  up  and  he \n starts  like  walking  around  the  CL  he's \n never  done  this  I  luckily  sat  in  the \n back  but  everyone  else  in  the  middle \n were  [ __ ]  wa  so  basically  I  got  away \n with  it  because  I  was  in  the  back  so \n every  time  his  back  was  right  I  would \n just  like  quickly  like  memorize \n everything  on  the  PowerPoint  and  then  do \n it  I  got  a  B  minus  but  I  was  happy  with \n that  but  then  as  people  are  leaving  it's \n easier  and  easier  to  check  right  so  I \n see  the  people  they're  like  sweating \n because  they've  been  cheating  all  whole \n semester  and  the  teachers  won't  that \n kind  of  paid  off  for  you  in  a  way  cuz \n you  didn't  cheat  all  semester  so  you \n would  have  remembered  more  if  you  didn't \n cheat  you  know  what  I  mean  yeah  I  think \n I  just  did  it  just  to  like  I  don't  know \n I  there  was  like  a  chunk  I  didn't  know \n or  something  like  that  I  felt  really  bad \n for  them  like  the  kids  were  like  yeah \n I'm  like  o  good  luck  guys  they  deserve \n God
