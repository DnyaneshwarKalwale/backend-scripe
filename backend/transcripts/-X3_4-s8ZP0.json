And  especially  if  you  have  to  just \n bat. \n So  in  our  time,  the  one  who  had  the \n bat  used  to  bat  first.   Right? \n Sounds \n familiar  and  I  did  not  have  money  to \n buy  a  bat,  so  my  batting  was  not  effective. \n So  I  used  to  ask  God \n why  does  this  happen  to  me?   And  I  used \n to  get  a  voice  inside  that  my  child. \n Your  destiny  is  in  your  hands.   Work \n hard  and  create  your \n destiny.   There  will  be  walls,  create \n barriers.   Make  a  small  string  in  it \n and  cross \n it.   And  make  an  elevator  and  an  escalator \n even \n better.   Right? \n So  I,  I  was  always  thankful  to  the  God  that  he  was \n guiding  me  and  I  started  working  hard  with  that  principal,  I  worked  hard  thinking \n \n that  I  will  crack  IIT,  I \n worked  very  hard,  dad,  I  crack  IIT,  no  it's  tough  right  here  are \n 11th  12th  grade \n students  preparing  for \n IIT?   It  was  tough  for  me.   I  could  not \n crack.   But  I  got  admission  in  two  colleges. \n One  was  a  great \n college.   And  trust  me \n brother,  his  fees  were  also  very  amazing. \n And  second,  a  very  new \n college.   It  had  very  less  credibility,  at \n that  point  in  time. \n But  it  was  a  free \n seat.   So  the  obvious  choice  was  to  go  for  a  free \n seat.   So  I  took  admission  in  college.   I \n started  studying.   And  then  you  always  have  a  good \n friend.   Who  is  not  educated  from  a  good  college. \n And  he  tells  you.   Friend,  there  is \n a  software  competition  going  on  in  your  university. \n And  I  am  participating  in  that. \n And  it  clicks  immediately,  friend,  I  also  want  to \n participate. \n So  I  rushed  to  my  principal's  office  and \n I  asked  him  sir,  has  any \n invitation  come  to  our  college  to \n participate  in  that  software \n competition  and  he  said  son,  it  has  come  but  it \n is  a  very  very  tough  competition,  very  intense,  it \n is  for  the  big  leagues,  IITs,  not  for \n us,  so  I  requested  him  can  we  get  a \n chance  to  participate  in  it  and  he  agreed, \n then  what?   I  worked  very  hard,  worked  very  hard \n \n for that competition.   The \n result  was  we  got  all  those \n \n good  college  teams,  IITs  and  finally  we \n defeated  them.   We  got  the  first  prize \n and  the  first  was \n ₹2000  it  was  a  lot  of  money  in  1999. \n ₹2000 \n so  I  came  back  to  college  and  at  the  college  gate  the  entire \n college  was  standing  and \n waiting  with  that  dhol  music  and  everybody \n dancing  it  was  a  different  environment  all \n together  and  a  small  bread  pakora  party  was \n arranged  in  the  canteen.   So  the \n Principal  Sir  came  and  praised  me  a  lot.    I \n supported  you  a  lot  and  he  said  child, \n you  participate  in  any \n competition  and  we  will  support  you.   You  have \n brought  a  lot  of  recognition  to  this \n college.   Just  what  then?   Started  participating  in  competitions.    The \n \n college  was  already  paying  the  money. \n Price  money  also  started  getting  collected. \n So  I  collected  full  ₹10,000.   Win \n win \n competitions  and  with  that \n money  and  my  computer  which  was  in  hostel \n I  along  with  my  two  friends  started  a \n company.   So  at  that  time  of  na.com,  the \n year  was  2000.   So  people  used  to  make  websites  and \n sell  them  for  Rs  100  crores.   So  we  thought \n we  will  make  it  too.   We  will  also  get  Rs  100  crore. \n  \n So  but  life  is  not  so  easy.   Trust \n Me  June  200  We  Came  Out  of  College  and  July \n 200  The  Dr.  Com  Bubble \n Busted.   Now  there  are  no  venture \n capitalists,  no  investments,  no  work \n in  the  market.   So  we  used  to  call  up  IT \n companies  and  ask  them  that  sir  if  you  have  any  project  to \n give  us  then  please  give  it  to  us. \n Everywhere  the  answer  was \n no.   So  one \n day  we  got  a  call  from  a  company  they  were \n writing  some  technical \n articles  on  the  software \n languages.   So  they  asked  us  that  they  are \n looking  for  people  to  help  them  with \n technical  validation  of  those  technical \n articles.   So  first  of  all  I  asked,  brother, \n what  is  this  work?   I  refused.   Then  suddenly  I \n remembered,  oh  brother,  I  still  have  to  pay  the  electricity  bill  and \n this  month's  salary  of  the  PN \n and  they  were  offering  me  Rs.  2500  for  one  article,  so \n I  quickly  grabbed  four  articles  and \n said  I  will  get  Rs.  10,  this  will  cover  some  of  my  expenses, \n \n so  we  review  those  articles,  give  them \n back,  they  really  love  the \n quality,  so  they  said  we  have  four \n articles  and \n can  you  do  this  on  the  main  frames?   I  said \n yes  why  not,  we  have  a  lot  of  experience  with \n main  frames.   Our  team  knows  a  lot,  please \n give  it  to \n us.   Again  life  is  not  so  easy.    The \n client  was  even \n smarter.   He  says \n give  me  the  biodata  and  CV  of  those  who  will  work  on  these.   I  got  hurt, \n brother. \n In  our  team,  till  today,  knowing  the  main  frame  is \n far  away,  in  fact  we  had  not  even  seen \n  \n it.   So  we  thought  what  to  do  now?   Some \n solution  will  have  to  be  found. \n So  a  win-win  situation  a \n strategy  was  decided.   We \n told  the  client  that  those  who  work  on  Main  Flames, \n these  are  people  in  big  companies \n who  have  access.   And  they  work \n as  a  freelancer  with  us.   But  they  don't  have  their \n CVs  and  biodatas  with  you.   But  we  we \n understand  your  problem.   You  have  this \n problem,  right?  If  the  work  is  sub-standard  and \n not  good,  then  your  money  will  be  wasted. \n So  let's  do  one  thing.   Let  us  work \n on  these  articles.   Give  it  to  you.   If  you \n like  it  only  then  pay  us.   Otherwise  don't  pay \n us.   And  they  happily  agreed. \n We  read  about  main  frames. \n Worked  very  hard.   Well  reviewed. \n Returned  articles  to  client.   And  when  they  sent  it \n to  their  clients  it  was  the  best  ever \n feedback  that  they  got  from  their \n clients.   So  slowly  more  business  started  coming. \n \n Slowly  and  gradually  the  growth  started. \n But  somewhere  in  my  mind  it  was  like  this,  this  much \n growth  is  not  enough.   We  want  more  growth, \n so  what  should  we  do \n ?   Then  I  implemented  a  strategy. \n Crossed  another  barrier.   I \n \n told  them  that \n we  have  taken  our  office  in  the  building  just  behind  the  client's  office.    I \n told  him, \n Sir,  you  work  with  more  than  30  vendors. \n Follow  up  with  everyone.   Nobody  ever \n \n picks  up  your  call.   Nobody  ever  gives  you  work  on  time. \n Your  life  is \n measurable.   Why  don't  you  give  this  work  to \n us?   We're  in  the  building  behind  you. \n You  will  also  have  complete  control. \n Quality  will  also  be  there,  your  life  will  become  easy. \n Now  this  idea  stuck  to  their  mind \n and  we  started  getting  more  business.   Our \n business  got \n tripled.   But  the  hunger  for  growth  still  did  not  diminish.    had \n  \n increased  threefold.   Now  how  to  bring  about  the  next  phase  of \n growth?   So  our \n annual  contract  renewal  was  due  with  that  client. \n And  that  contract  had  a  list  of \n 50  companies  we  couldn't  work  with. \n If  we  have  to  work  with  this  client,  then  we \n cannot  work  with  those  50  companies. \n So  we \n thought  we  can  not  grow  depending  only  on  one \n client.   We  have  to  grow.   So  we  took  a \n conscious  call  not  to  renew  the \n agreement.   What  happened?   From  the  next  day  100% \n business  collapsed.   Had  to  happen.   So \n what  did  we  do?   So  we  had  our  first \n sales  person.   We  build  a  sales  team.   We \n started  acquiring  new \n clients.   Gradually  the  business  started  growing  further.   It \n grew  so  much  that  NASCOM  awarded  us \n with  Emerging  50  Companies  of  India  Award. \n Deloitte  Awarded  US  for  Fastest  50  Tech \n Companies  of  India  Award  for  Four  Years  in \n a \n Row.   We  started  getting  awards  from \n all  over  the  world.   We  started  working \n with  clients  in  the  US, \n Europe,  Australia  and  the  Middle  East. \n And  looking  at  this  tremendous \n growth  a  US  based  group  acquired  us  in \n 2021  at  a  mind  boggling \n price  thank  you  got  so  during \n \n this \n journey  I  got \n awarded  in  the  Fortune  40  and  40  I  even \n made  a  Blimey  book  of \n records  I  started  multiple  companies \n and  many  of  them  they  got  really \n successful.   So  what  do  we  get  to  learn  from  this  entire  picture  story \n \n ?   It's  simple. \n Life  will  remain  like  this. \n It  will  keep  throwing  challenges  to \n you.   It  will  keep  throwing  barriers  at \n you.   What  do  we  have  to  do? \n Some  problems  will  be  very  tiny,  small \n age,  whether  my  batting  will  come  or  not. \n Right?   And  as  big  as  you  have  lost  a \n client  and  100%  of  your  business  is \n down.   We  have  to  find  out  the  right \n bridge.   So,  what's  a  take  away.   No  matter \n how  big  the  problem  is.   It  doesn't \n matter.   It  has  always  had  a  hidden  it  It  has \n always  had  a  hidden  bridge  in \n it.   What  should  be  done  for  that? \n A little \n bit  of  our  own  Jugaad  will  be  needed.   It \n  \n will  take  a  little  creativity.   We'll  have  to  create  a  little  win-win  situation.   It \n will  take  a  little  persistence.   And  there  will  be  a  lot  of \n belief  that  yes.   I  can  do  it.   I  can \n cross \n it.   So  next  time  you  are  faced  with  a  mountainous \n problem,  look  at  it  calmly. \n Find  out  where  is  that \n bridge?   Because \n your \n success,  your \n life  is  all  about  moving  from  barriers \n to \n bridges.   Did  you  understand? \n Thank  you. \n [music]",
