  "transcript": "You  are  posting  on  LinkedIn,  but  your \n LinkedIn  posts  look  like  this  with  very \n low  impressions.  Or  maybe  you  want  to \n post  on  LinkedIn,  but  you  are  afraid  to \n create  posts  that  look  like  this.  Don't \n worry,  I  understand  your  frustration \n because  you  have  things  to  say.  You  have \n your  expertise,  but  you  struggle  to  get \n performance  on  LinkedIn.  I've  been  here \n before.  You  can  have  a  look  at  this  post \n which  I  posted  in  2021.  You  see,  it  got \n low  impressions.  But  now  look  at  this \n one  that  I've  posted  in  2024.  or  look  at \n this  other  one  that  I've  posted  in  2025. \n They  are  getting  millions  of \n impressions.  So,  I  went  from  having  bad \n results  on  my  LinkedIn  post  to \n generating  millions  of  impressions  and \n views.  And  in  this  video,  I'm  going  to \n explain  why  your  post  are  not  getting \n past  1,000  views  and  what  you  can  do  in \n order  to  fix  this  problem.  The  problem \n when  you  are  not  getting  enough \n impressions  on  your  LinkedIn  posts  is \n that  you  have  an  interesting  insight,  an \n interesting  topic  that  comes  from  your \n expertise,  your  industry  experience,  but \n when  you  have  to  write  it  down  on  a  post \n and  hit  publish,  it's  getting  harder. \n Either  you  have  the  blank  page  syndrome \n or  you  are  writing  but  you  are  not  sure \n about  how  to  write  it,  what  framework  to \n use  and  so  on.  And  at  the  end,  this  is \n very  frustrating.  I've  felt  it  before \n because  the  end  results  and  the \n performance  doesn't  look  like  what  you \n had  in  mind  when  you  were  thinking  about \n the  post  in  your  mind.  It's  very  clear \n what  you  want  to  talk  about  and  you  know \n it's  going  to  be  interesting  for  a  lot \n of  people  but  the  end  result  is  low \n impressions.  So  now  I'm  going  to  tell \n you  what  is  the  exact  problem  that  you \n are  facing.  The  problem  you  are  facing \n is  that  you  are  not  attracting  the \n attention  of  your  audience  with  your \n post.  So,  as  a  result,  they  don't  click \n on  view  more  when  they  see  your  post. \n So,  what  happens  instead  is  that  they \n scroll  past  and  they  don't  spend  time  on \n your  post.  But  don't  worry,  I'm  going  to \n give  you  a  solution  right  after.  But \n first,  what  you  need  to  understand  is \n that  when  people  scroll  past  your  post, \n it  sends  a  negative  signal  to  the \n algorithm.  It  tells  to  the  algorithm \n that  your  post  is  not  interesting \n because  people  are  not  spending  enough \n time  on  it.  This  is  what  we  call  the \n dwell  time.  So  dwell  time  is  the  total \n time  spent  on  your  post.  It's  the  same \n for  every  algorithm  on  any  platform \n because  the  goal  of  a  social  media \n platform  or  a  content  platform  is  to \n retain  the  users  so  they  spend  more  time \n on  the  app.  And  so  if  people  don't  spend \n enough  time  on  your  post,  the  algorithm \n will  think  this  post  is  not  really  good. \n People  don't  read  it.  So  that  mean  they \n are  not  interested.  So  that  means  it's \n not  the  right  post.  And  I  know  this  is \n very  frustrating  and  it's  hard  to  hear. \n But  I'm  going  to  give  you  the  solution \n to  explain  the  solution  to  this  problem. \n I'm  going  to  talk  about  three  important \n aspects  that  you  need  to  use  right  now \n for  your  LinkedIn  posts  in  order  to \n increase  your  number  of  views.  This  is \n the  things  that  I  teach  to  all  my \n students  in  my  course  and  in  my  boot \n camp.  I  help  them  to  increase  their \n impressions  engagement  so  they  have  more \n profile  viewers.  The  first  important \n aspect  is  to  have  interesting  insights. \n So  it's  very  important  for  you  to \n understand  this.  People  love  content \n that  is  unique  and  that  they  cannot  find \n anywhere  else.  Okay?  So  if  they  can  find \n the  content  on  Google  or  on  an  AI  tool, \n they  will  not  read  your  posts.  You  see, \n there  are  a  lot  of  posts  that  look  like \n blog  articles  like  seven  trends  in \n marketing  in  2025.  This  is  boring  and \n people  will  not  click  view  more  because \n they've  seen  this  kind  of  blog  article \n so  many  times.  Now,  of  course,  if  you \n are  a  famous  influencer  or  thought \n leader,  you  will  get  a  click  on  view \n more,  but  not  because  of  this  title,  but \n because  your  face  and  your  name  are \n famous.  So,  if  you  are  trying  to  go \n above  1,000  impressions  and  even  above \n 10,000  impressions,  you  need  to  have  an \n interesting  insight.  So,  what  you  should \n do  is  analyze  what  you've  been  doing  in \n the  past  6  months  and  ask  yourself  this, \n what  are  the  most  interesting  insights \n that  I've  discovered  in  those  past  6 \n months?  Maybe  it  comes  from  a \n conversation  with  a  client  or  with  a \n colleague.  Maybe  it's  an  in-depth \n analysis  that  you've  done  in  the  past. \n Or  maybe  it's  something  that  you  did,  an \n experimentation  that  you  want  to  talk \n about.  So  when  you  have  this  interesting \n insight,  it's  time  to  go  to  the  second \n very  important  aspect.  It's  to  have  an \n angle  and  a  hook.  So  you  see  when  you \n are  writing  on  LinkedIn  or  on  any  other \n social  channel,  you  need  to  attract  the \n attention  with  a  hook.  So  people  stop \n the  scroll  in  order  to  give  you  the \n attention.  So  even  if  the  insight  you \n are  sharing  is  very  interesting  but  your \n hook  is  not  good  and  is  not  attracting \n the  attention  your  post  will  fail.  So \n what  you  should  do  is  make  sure  that  you \n spend  enough  time  on  this.  First  you're \n going  to  ask  yourself  in  my  idea  in  my \n insight  what  is  the  most  interesting \n part?  How  could  I  trigger  curiosity?  It \n needs  to  be  specific.  So  you  are  talking \n about  one  specific  aspect.  It  needs  to \n be  simple.  Don't  use  complex  words  or \n jargon  or  anything  that  would  make  the \n hook  too  complex.  And  also  it  needs  to \n be  unique.  So  specific,  simple,  unique. \n This  is  the  things  that  I  teach  to  all \n my  students  in  my  course  so  they  have \n more  profile  viewers.  Now  when  you  have \n this  precise  angle,  you  can  write  your \n hook.  And  in  order  to  help  you,  I'm \n going  to  show  you  seven  hooks  that  I've \n used  in  the  past  14  days  in  order  to  get \n hundred  of  thousands  of  views.  Hook \n number  one,  you're  going  to  share  a \n milestone  that  you've  achieved  and  the \n lesson  learned  along  the  way.  So  here, \n as  you  can  see,  I  say,  \"My  newsletter \n just  hit  25,000  subscribers.  Nine  rules \n I  wish  I  knew  when  I  started  in  2023.\" \n So  you  can  write  it  like  this.  My  thing \n just  hit  milestone.  X  rules  I  wish  I \n knew  when.  Here  you  can  include  when  I \n started  or  you  can  include  the  date. \n Hook  number  two,  it's  slightly \n different.  You're  going  to  share  what \n you  are  doing  now,  not  what  you've \n achieved.  And  you're  going  to  explain \n the  lessons  as  well.  I'm  building  my \n second  sevenf  figureure  business.  Here \n are  10  rules  I  wish  I  knew  in  my  first \n business.  I'm  building  thing  X  role  I \n wish  I  knew  when.  And  here  you  introduce \n what  you  were  doing  in  the  past.  Hook \n number  three.  You're  going  to  give  your \n opinion  about  a  trend  that  is \n interesting  inside  your  industry.  But \n here  is  the  trick.  You  need  to  justify \n why  they  should  listen  to  you.  So  here \n is  my  post.  my  honest  opinion  about \n personal  brands  based  on  48  million \n views  and  150,000  followers  online.  So \n you  see  here  I  talk  about  personal \n brands  very  trendy  topic  right  now  and  I \n say  that  my  analysis  is  based  on  a  lot \n of  experience  48  million  views  and \n 150,000  followers.  So  here  is  the \n template  my  honest  opinion  about  trend \n based  on  what  makes  you  legit.  Hook \n number  four  very  easy  and  simple  list \n the  problems  in  your  industry.  So  here \n nine  business  strategy  problems  and  you \n can  use  this  template  X  industry \n problems.  Hook  number  five  explain  a \n fact  in  your  industry  or  about  a \n specific  skill.  So  here  is  my  example \n fact  your  content  won't  bring  results  if \n and  here  I  list  the  reasons  your \n solution  is  ineffective  etc.  The \n template  is  fact.  You  can  also  delete \n fact  and  start  from  your  skill  won't \n work  if  and  then  you  list  the  reasons. \n Hook  number  six.  I've  started  using  this \n hook  and  now  a  lot  of  people  are  really \n using  it.  It's  to  have  a  conversation \n between  your  ICP  and  yourself.  So  your \n ICP  is  your  ideal  customer  profile.  Here \n is  my  example  founder.  I  want  my \n marketing  and  sales  team  to  collaborate. \n Me  here  are  seven  aspects  you  should \n work  on.  So  the  template  is  ICP.  I  want \n to  outcome.  So  here  you  insert  the \n outcome  and  me  here  are  how  to  do  it. \n You  introduce  how  they  should  do  it. \n Hook  number  seven.  You're  going  to \n explain  the  one  important  thing  that \n you've  analyzed  based  on  your \n experience.  So  here  is  my  example.  I've \n helped  over  400  businesses  with \n marketing.  Most  of  them  face  this \n situation.  Make  sure  to  subscribe  to \n this  channel  because  I'm  doing  an  entire \n video  about  this  post  and  I'm  analyzing \n the  infographic  that  I've  used.  So  here \n is  the  template.  I've  helped  over  X  and \n then  you  insert  target  audience  with \n insert  your  skill.  Most  of  them  face \n this  situation.  Now  of  course  you  can \n change  situation  with  problem  or  with \n another  keyword  that  makes  sense  for \n you.  All right.  Now  you  know  how  to \n write  a  good  hook.  So  now  I  will  move  on \n to  aspect  number  three  which  is  the  last \n one  but  it's  also  very  important.  It's \n the  formatting.  You  see  if  your  hook \n attracts  the  attention  so  people  click \n view  more  but  what  they  see  is  a  long \n boring  text  they  will  scroll  past  and \n you  will  get  an  extra  boost  from  the \n view  more  but  you  will  not  have  a \n complete  boost  because  after  they  click \n view  more  they  leave.  So  what  happens \n when  you  do  that  is  that  you  are \n creating  a  deceiving  hook.  People  are \n hooked.  They  are  very  interested  about \n what  you're  going  to  say.  Then  they \n click  view  more  and  they  get  bored \n instantly.  So  what  you're  going  to  do \n instead  is  to  have  a  structure  in  order \n to  write  a  good  post.  You  have  different \n structures  that  I  teach  in  my  course. \n You  can  also  have  a  look  at  my  other \n YouTube  videos.  My  favorite  one  is  PAS \n problem  agitate  solution.  You  also  have \n BAB  before  after  bridge  or  another  one \n which  is  called  ADA.  A  I  D  A  or  you  also \n have  a  storytelling  framework  where  you \n start  from  a  normal  situation  then \n something  that  add  a  problem  and  then \n you  continue  the  story.  So  it's  very \n important  that  you  respect  a \n copyrightiting  framework  but  also  make \n sure  that  your  post  is  schemable.  So \n schemable  means  that  it  will  be  easy  for \n your  audience  to  scan  your  post  because \n people  don't  really  read  your  LinkedIn \n post.  What  they  do  instead  is  that  they \n scan  it.  They  read  one  sentence  here  and \n then  they  jump  to  the  next  sentence  and \n then  they  jump  to  another  paragraph. \n Maybe  they  get  back  to  the  hook  and  if \n it's  not  interesting,  they  leave.  But  if \n they  feel  it's  interesting,  they  will \n stay  on  the  post  and  read  it  all.  So \n here  is  an  example  of  a  post  that  is \n really  easy  to  read  thanks  to  the \n formatting.  The  hook  here  is  I  create \n over  40  pieces  of  content  per  week.  Here \n are  my  seven  repurposing  tactics.  And \n you  see  here,  it's  very  easy  to  read. \n You  just  have  to  read  the  seven  rules. \n It's  two  lines  maximum  for  each  roles. \n And  also,  I  jump  a  line  between  the \n rules,  so  it's  easier  to  read  on  mobile. \n Yeah,  you  might  ask  yourself  why \n everyone  is  jumping  line  on  LinkedIn. \n It's  simply  because  it's  easier  to  read \n on  mobile.  You  can  see  here  I've  used \n the  exact  same  framework  for  this  post, \n my  honest  opinion  about  personal  brands \n based  on  48  million  views  and  150,000 \n followers  online.  And  then  I  list  seven \n points  linked  to  my  opinion.  Here  is \n another  post  that  I  did  where  it's  very \n easy  to  read.  It's  schemable  fact  your \n content  won't  bring  results  if  and  here \n I  list  all  the  reasons.  Then  there  is  a \n short  sentence  and  by  results  I  mean \n return  on  investment  ROI.  Then  two \n bullet  points  then  another  sentence  and \n then  bullet  points  again.  You  see  when \n you  see  this  post  it  feels  like  it's  not \n going  to  be  too  hard  to  read.  So  this  is \n what  you  should  aim  for.  So,  now  you  get \n it.  In  order  to  go  above  1,000 \n impressions  and  even  10,000  impressions \n on  your  LinkedIn  posts,  first  you  need \n an  interesting  insight  to  talk  about  in \n your  post.  It  needs  to  be  relatable  for \n your  audience.  So,  you  need  to  talk \n about  one  of  their  problems,  objective, \n or  you  need  to  talk  about  something  that \n is  important  in  their  day-to-day. \n Second,  you  need  a  very  good  angle.  And \n for  this,  you  need  to  write  a  hook  that \n will  attract  the  attention.  For  this, \n you  can  use  the  templates  that  I've \n shared,  but  you  can  also  use  your  own \n copyrightiting  style.  And  last  but  not \n least,  in  order  to  retain  the  attention \n and  to  have  people  spend  more  time  on \n your  posts,  you  have  to  format  your \n LinkedIn  posts  with  different \n copyrightiting  frameworks  such  as  PAS  or \n BAB.  And  also  use  simple  sentences,  jump \n lines,  and  use  the  right  structure  with \n bullet  points  in  order  to  retain \n attention.
