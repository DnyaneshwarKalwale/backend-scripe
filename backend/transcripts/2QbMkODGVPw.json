  "transcript": "Everyone  told  you  to  build  a  personal \n brand.  They  said  it's  going  to  change \n your  business.  They  said  you're  going  to \n attract  so  many  clients  without  even \n selling.  They  said  it  will  change  your \n life.  And  honestly,  they  are  not  wrong. \n Personal  branding  is  a  powerful  sales \n tool.  Unfortunately,  most  people  face \n this  problem.  You  are  applying  all  the \n pieces  of  advice  that  they  are  telling \n you  to  build  your  personal  brand.  You \n are  publishing  content  on  LinkedIn.  You \n are  recording  videos  for  YouTube  and \n Instagram.  You  present  yourself  as  the \n expert  in  your  industry,  but  the  problem \n is  that  you  don't  get  the  results  that \n they  promised  you.  People  don't  follow \n you.  You  feel  like  you  don't  have  any \n influence,  growth,  or  impact.  And  the \n worst  part  is  that  this  personal \n branding  thing  doesn't  sell  anything. \n Well,  do  you  want  to  know  why?  Here  is \n the  reason.  You  focus  too  much  on  what  a \n personal  brand  looks  like  and  not  enough \n on  its  foundations.  followers,  the \n authority,  the  likes,  the  engagement. \n It's  not  the  brand.  It's  not  the \n authority.  It's  just  the  reflection.  The \n real  brand  and  all  the  work  necessary \n for  it  is  hidden  below  the  surface  like \n an  iceberg.  What  people  admire  is  the \n shiny  top.  Wow,  they  have  a  personal \n brand.  I  want  one,  too.  It  looks  so \n good.  I'm  going  to  attract  so  many \n clients.  But  it's  just  the  visible  part \n above  the  surface.  What  they  ignore  is \n what  actually  holds  it  up  below  the \n surface.  There  is  a  lot  of  trial  and \n error  involved.  There  is  a  lot  of  hard \n work,  a  lot  of  content  creation.  All  the \n things  that  are  below  the  surface,  it \n what  really  matters.  Personally,  I  never \n tried  to  create,  build  and  grow  a \n personal  brand.  I  focused  without  even \n knowing  it  on  what  matters,  the  hidden \n part  of  the  iceberg.  And  today  I  have \n over  150,000  followers  online.  I \n generated  over  50  million  views  and \n indeed  I  attract  clients  with  my \n content.  You  want  to  know  how  I  managed \n to  do  this?  I'm  going  to  explain  it  in \n this  video.  For  this,  let's  have  a  look \n at  the  iceberg  with  the  four  layers  that \n are  below  the  surface  and  that  you \n really  need  to  focus  on  in  order  to \n create  your  personal  brand.  But  remember \n that  the  personal  brand  is  just  the \n byproduct,  the  output  of  all  this  work \n that  you're  going  to  do.  So  the  first \n layer  I  want  to  talk  about  is  focus.  So \n focus  is  a  keyword  that  means  a  lot  of \n different  things.  But  here  what  I  mean \n is  that  you  need  to  focus  on  one  target \n audience,  one  expertise  and  one  offer. \n Why?  Because  if  you're  trying  to  do  too \n many  things  at  the  same  time  for  too \n many  different  people,  you  will  dilute \n your  positioning.  People  will  struggle \n to  understand  who  you  are,  what  messages \n you  use,  and  ultimately  what  you  are \n doing  for  them.  So  it's  really  important \n that  you  focus  on  one  positioning  and \n this  way  you  will  be  able  to  build  on \n this  topic  on  this  expertise  and  create \n a  personal  brand  that  has  solid \n foundations  because  you  will  not  hop  on \n every  new  trends.  You  will  not  try  too \n many  hacks.  You  will  just  have  a  solid \n expertise  that  you  can  rely  on.  So \n that's  the  first  layer  of  the  iceberg. \n The  focus.  The  second  layer  of  this \n iceberg  is  trial  and  errors  that  will \n ultimately  become  experience.  If  I \n learned  one  thing  about  content  from  all \n the  views  that  I've  generated  online, \n it's  that  people  love  content  and  engage \n with  content  that  brings  on  the  table  a \n unique  vision,  a  unique  perspective. \n Why?  Because  they  want  to  learn \n something  from  you  that  you've \n experienced  and  that  you've  experimented \n in  the  past.  They  don't  want  to  learn \n something  that  they  can  find  anywhere \n else  on  Google  with  AI  tools  or  on  any \n blog  article.  What  they  want  is  to  know \n your  unique  vision,  your  unique  point  of \n view  and  especially  what  you  are  saying \n that  is  different  from  others  because  if \n they  wanted  to  have  platitudes  or  to \n have  generic  rules  indeed  they  would  use \n Google  or  gen  AI  tools.  So  keep  this  in \n mind.  No  one  will  follow  you  and  you \n will  never  have  any  influence  if  you \n repeat  the  same  information  that  is \n available  everywhere  else.  And  for  this \n as  I  said  the  foundation  so  the  second \n layer  of  the  iceberg  is  to  have  an \n experience  in  a  specific  topic.  For \n example,  when  I  started  posting  on \n LinkedIn  in  2022,  I  was  focusing  on \n growth  marketing  and  I  was  sharing  all \n the  experimentation  that  I  was  doing  in \n my  agency  back  then.  So,  what  I  was \n doing  is  that  I  was  working  for  my \n clients.  I  was  experimenting  new  tactics \n such  as  Google  ads,  LinkedIn  or  emails. \n I  was  analyzing  the  results  and  I  was \n presenting  the  results  on  my  LinkedIn. \n So  this  way  people  were  not  following \n generic  advice  or  generic  rules  about \n growth  marketing.  They  were  following  my \n account  because  they  knew  everything  I \n was  sharing  was  based  on  my  experience. \n So  you  see  this  is  the  main  difference. \n If  I  didn't  do  this,  I  would  not  have \n been  able  to  grow  my  account  like  it  is \n today  with  over  135,000  followers.  So \n the  first  layer  was  to  focus  on  a \n positioning.  The  second  layer  is  to \n build  a  real  experience  to  be  able  to \n create  unique  content.  Now  let's  talk \n about  layer  number  three  which  is  to \n have  a  deep  expertise.  As  you  can  see \n online,  everyone  is  an  expert.  They  say \n that  they  are  an  expert  in  AI,  web  3, \n blockchain,  ads,  social  selling, \n anything.  But  the  truth  is  that  they  are \n just  repeating  the  same  information  that \n they  find  anywhere  else.  So  you  see  here \n the  layer  number  three  is  really  linked \n to  layer  number  two  because  you  have  a \n deep  experience.  You  are  able  to  analyze \n this  experience  and  to  get  a  specific \n expertise  that  makes  you  unique.  You \n know  we  can  call  this  a  signature  idea \n or  a  big  idea.  Think  about  Simon  Synek \n for example  who  came  up  with  the  concept \n of  start  with  the  why.  you  know  with \n this  specific  big  idea  he  was  able  to \n write  some  books  he  was  able  to  go  to \n conferences  write  hundreds  of  social \n posts  YouTube  videos  podcast  interviews \n and  so  on  because  he  has  a  deep \n experience  in  management  he's  able  to \n have  a  deep  expertise  and  a  signature \n concept  of  big  idea  and  so  he's  able  to \n talk  about  it  everywhere  and  people \n associate  his  name  Simon  Synek  with  the \n concept  cept  start  with  the  why.  You \n have  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of \n people  who  are  doing  this.  For  me,  I \n created  the  authority  first  framework. \n So  the  authority  first  framework  is  a \n way  to  position  yourself  as  an  authority \n in  your  industry  thanks  to  content.  You \n can  have  a  look  at  my  course  that \n explains  how  you  can  do  that  in  your \n industry  and  for  your  career.  So  here \n the  goal  is  simple.  First,  you  need  to \n analyze  everything  that  you  are  doing  in \n your  day-to-day.  Second,  you  need  to \n identify  patterns  in  this  day-to-day.  A \n pattern  is  something  that  repeats  itself \n over  and  over.  For  example,  if  you  are \n running  Google  ads,  you  will  notice  some \n specific  patterns  about  how  to  generate \n more  results  for  your  clients.  And  based \n on  this  analysis,  you  will  be  able  to \n create  a  big  idea  or  a  signature  concept \n that  you  will  be  able  to  reuse  in  your \n day-to-day  later  on  and  that  you  will  be \n able  to  reuse  in  your  content  as  well. \n And  remember,  it's  really  about  making \n your  positioning  different  from  the \n competition,  different  from  other \n creators,  and  different  from  other \n people  who  are  also  trying  to  create \n their  personal  brand.  Because  if  your \n content  and  ultimately  your  personal \n brand  is  the  same  as  everyone  else, \n ultimately  you  will  not  attract  any \n attention  because  you  are  just  a  distant \n noise  in  a  jungle  of  other  personal \n brands.  Remember,  it's  all  about  being \n unique.  And  this  leads  me  to  the  last \n layer  of  the  iceberg,  which  is  where  you \n will  spend  most  of  your  time.  It's  of \n course  content  creation.  Now,  content \n creation  is  not  only  about  writing  and \n publishing.  You  need  to  be  strategic \n about  it.  How  to  do  that?  First,  you \n need  to  of  course  know  what  is  your \n focus.  So,  your  positioning,  your  target \n audience,  and  your  messaging.  So,  what \n are  you  going  to  talk  about?  Based  on \n this,  you  need  to  create  what  we  call \n content  pillars.  I  teach  exactly  how  to \n do  that  in  my  course.  Content  pillars \n are  the  key  topics  and  subtopics  that \n you  will  be  talking  about  in  your \n content  because  if  you  talk  about  too \n many  different  topics,  you  will  dilute \n your  positioning  and  people  will  not  be \n able  to  know  what  your  personal  brand  is \n about.  So  that's  why  you  need  content \n pillars.  You  also  need  to  have  a  strong \n point  of  view  that  is  linked  to  your  big \n idea  that  I  explained  just  before.  You \n also  need  to  have  an  enemy.  So  who  are \n you  fighting?  And  by  fighting  of  course \n I  mean  how  do  you  use  your  ideas,  your \n concepts  and  your  expertise  to  prevent \n your  target  clients,  your  audience  to \n have  this  problem  which  is  the  enemy. \n Once  you  have  this  content  strategy  in \n place  you  need  to  publish  consistently \n on  the  channel  of  your  choice. \n Personally  I  would  advise  to  have  three \n different  channels  but  you  can  start \n first  from  LinkedIn.  Then  you  can  add  a \n newsletter  and  then  you  can  have  a \n YouTube  channel.  So  you  have  first  the \n LinkedIn  content,  short,  impactful \n posts.  You  can  publish  carousels, \n infographics,  photos  of  yourself,  but \n also  videos.  Here  it's  all  about  sharing \n your  opinion,  explaining  your  expertise \n with  howtos  and  case  studies.  Then  you \n have  the  newsletter  with  long-  form \n content.  Make  sure  to  reuse  your \n LinkedIn  post  to  create  your  newsletter \n so  you  win  time  and  you  reuse  the  best \n ideas  from  LinkedIn  to  create  your  long- \n form  newsletter.  In  the  newsletter,  it's \n all  about  connecting  more  deeply  with \n your  audience  by  sharing  in-depth \n information  and  helping  them  on  a \n long-term  basis.  So,  when  you  have  your \n newsletter,  you  then  need  to  add  YouTube \n videos  with  shorts  and  long  videos.  Here \n you  will  be  able  to  develop  your  big \n idea,  your  concepts.  And  keep  in  mind \n that  you  also  need  to  have  content \n pillars  for  your  YouTube  channel.  So, \n you  make  sure  to  have  a  strong \n positioning  on  YouTube.  So  content \n creation  is  really  a  dense  topic.  Make \n sure  to  follow  my  channel  because  I \n share  a  lot  of  tips  about  how  to  create \n content.  And  you  can  also  have  a  look  at \n my  course  where  I  explain  exactly  how  to \n create  content.  Now  what's  going  to \n happen  is  that  because  you  publish \n content  consistently  on  one  or  multiple \n channels,  people  will  start  noticing \n you,  you  will  attract  their  attention. \n And  because  you  are  talking  about  the \n same  topic  over  and  over,  they  will \n listen  to  you  more  for  this  specific \n topic  here.  Again,  make  sure  that  you \n don't  deletute  your  positioning  and  your \n personal  brand.  You  need  to  stick  to \n your  content  pillars.  And  thanks  to  this \n last  layer  which  is  below  the  surface  of \n the  personal  brand  iceberg,  you  will  be \n able  to  get  followers,  get  engagement, \n so  likes  and  comments  and  ultimately  you \n will  be  able  to  build  influence  and  this \n will  be  above  the  surface.  It's  what \n will  be  visible  from  other  people.  And \n when  you  will  arrive  at  this  point  with \n a  lot  of  followers,  a  lot  of  influence, \n you  will  remember  that  everything  that \n matters  was  what  is  below  the  surface, \n but  you  will  also  enjoy  the  benefits  of \n what  is  above  the  surface.  Indeed, \n because  now  you  have  more  followers, \n people  trust  you  more  because  you  are \n perceived  as  an  expert.  Because  you  have \n more  engagement,  you  have  more \n impressions.  And  because  you  have  more \n impressions,  you  have  more  visits  on \n your  profiles  and  on  your  landing  pages \n or  websites.  So  ultimately,  you  make \n more  sales.  And  also  because  of  the \n followers  and  the  engagement,  you  get \n more  opportunities.  Indeed,  you  get \n invited  to  podcasts.  You  get  invited  to \n speak  at  events  and  overall  people  want \n to  connect  with  you  in  order  to  be  in \n your  network  so  they  can  benefit  from \n your  expertise.  So  when  you  start  to \n have  this  benefits,  you  will  see  it's \n the  snowball  effects.  One  opportunities \n will  lead  to  10  other  opportunities \n which  will  lead  to  100  opportunities. \n And  this  is  the  snowball  effect.  It  goes \n faster  and  faster.  So  remember  that  this \n is  the  end  goal  of  your  personal  brand \n to  be  an  authority  in  your  industry.  But \n remember  as  well  that  you  need  to  focus \n on  the  four  layers  that  are  below  the \n surface  in  order  to  achieve  this  tip  of \n the  iceberg  which  is  the  end  result  that \n everyone  is  seeing.
