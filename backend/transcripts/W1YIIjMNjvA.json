 coming  back \n to  this  stupid  Park  every  time  I'm \n emtional  finding  out  when  you're  like  on \n the  operating  table  that  they're  going \n to  put  a  metal  piece  in  you  is  very \n [Music] \n frightening  hi  guys  how  are  you  good  I'm \n so  happy  to  hear  that  me  well  um \n honestly  there  are  some  things  I  haven't \n been  so  forthcoming  about  not  because  I \n didn't  want  to  but  just  because  there \n are  some  things  that  weigh  so  heavily  on \n you  that  they're  very  very  hard  to  share \n you  especially  don't  want  them  to  weigh \n heavily  on  others  so  it  kind  of  only \n feels  right  to  share  when  everything  is \n kind  of  straightened  out  so  let  me \n explain  and  let  me  run  you  back  the  last \n few  weeks  have  you  heard  of  evil  eye \n it's  a  concept  that's  really  really \n popular  in  Middle  Eastern  Arab  and \n Muslim  culture  it  refers  to  the  concept \n that  someone  can  essentially  curse  you \n with  their  gaze  with  their  eye  although \n typically  this  is  referenced  to  good \n things  like  luxurious  items  or  money \n things  that  other  people  Envy  so  whether \n it's  something  that's  really  good  but \n personal  or  really  bad  but  personal  I \n tend  to  keep  it  to  myself  until  I  can \n properly  handle  it  digest  it  process  it \n before  I  share  it  with  anyone  else  and \n in  today's  video  we'll  be  going  through \n a  few  of  those  things  and  what  I've  been \n up  to  the  last  few  weeks  let's  start  off \n with  something  good  as  some  of  you  guys \n may  already  know  Lily  and  I  launched  a \n podcast  together  it's  called  the  sweet \n and  sour  podcast  as  you  know  I  used  to \n do  a  solo  podcast  on  Spotify  called  DTA \n don't  tell  anyone  however  at  one  point  I \n realized  it  is  really  hard  to  talk  to \n yourself  for  an  hour  and  a  half  and  come \n up  with  new  or  interesting  things  to  say \n Loki  I  ran  out  of  stories  to  say  like \n there's  just  not  that  many  things \n happening  to  me  so  Lily  and  I  came \n together  to  launch  this  podcast  the \n podcast  is  now  our  hey  P  can  you  T  your \n microphone  please  please  stop  yelling  at \n me  we're  only  this  is  the  first  day  of \n work  we  need  to  have  a  good  work  culture \n cute  I  have  also  learned  not  to  share \n too  many  things  if  something  is  still  on \n the  works  because  frankly  a  lot  of \n things  fall  through  but  I'm  so  glad  that \n this  didn't  it's  honestly  been  the  most \n exciting  and  fulfilling  Endeavor  that \n I've  done  in  quite  some  time  and  I'm  so \n glad  that  it's  resonated  with  so  many  of \n you  guys  as  well  you  can  check  out  the \n sweet  and  sour  podcast  anywhere  that  you \n listen  to  or  watch  podcasts  including \n YouTube  my  brother  also  visited  me  in  La \n for  the  first  time  ever  which  I  know  is \n crazy  cuz  I've  lived  here  for  like  7 \n years  we're  arriving  at  one  of  my \n favorite  French  spots  in  La  look  at  all \n those  suckers  in  line  should  have  got  a \n reservation  like  me  very  thoughtful  very \n mindful  very  demure  I  don't  need  to \n stand  in  line  it  was  such  a  good  time  he \n came  with  his  fiance  I  took  them  to  a \n bunch  of  my  favorite  food  spots  and  it \n was  just  so  nice  and  refreshing  crushing \n to  see  family  and  it's  really  been  quite \n the  reminder  of  how  I  always  feel  like \n there's  a  hole  in  my  heart  living  in  LA \n because  I  don't  have  family  here  it's \n important  for  me  to  always  try  to  see \n them  as  much  as  I  can  I  also  went \n horseback  riding  for  the  first  time  ever \n my  friends  took  me  as  a  little  birthday \n gift  and  it's  been  on  my  bucket  list \n this  year  so  I'm  so  happy  to  have \n checked  it  off  it  was  really  fun  L  bro \n is  doing  amazing  he  has  pooped  a  lot \n he's  farted  a  lot  and  I'm  proud  of  him \n and  I've  already  gone  back  so  so  I  think \n this  might  be  a  little  hobby  that  I  pick \n up  on  the  side  oh  my  God  look  at  them \n they're  so  little  they  will  make  for \n such  a  good  KFC \n dinner  so  those  are  some  of  the  more  fun \n and  exciting  things  that  have  happened \n recently  however  throughout  these  last \n few  weeks  there  has  been  one  big \n underlying  thing  that  has  caused  me \n unfortunately  a  lot  of  stress  basically \n a  couple  months  ago  I  got  an  MRI  done  on \n a  bunch  of  parts  of  my  body  including  my \n chest  and  when  I  went  to  my  gynecologist \n she  looked  at  those  MRIs  and  she  said \n that  some  of  the  areas  on  my  chest  were \n a  little  bit  hard  to  read  just  to  be \n certain  she  wanted  to  order  some  more \n tests  I  had  to  do  a  couple  other \n ultrasounds  and  when  she  saw  the \n ultrasounds  she  still  felt  kind  of \n uncertain  about  the  findings  every  night \n before  one  of  these  appointments  I \n always  sleep  so  bad  cuz  I'm  just  so \n nervous  so  hopefully  it  goes  well  also  a \n few  years  ago  I  had  a  lumpectomy  done \n which  is  basically  when  they  find  a  lump \n somewhere  on  your  body  and  just  try  to \n remove  it  entirely  but  essentially  what \n these  tests  found  and  what  I  kind  of \n suspected  all  along  was  that  the  lump \n that  I  had  removed  a  few  years  ago  had \n been  growing  back  and  so  on  the  tests \n that's  why  it  kind  of  looked  weird  and \n whether  or  not  that  was  technically  a \n bad  growth  we  didn't \n know  so  after  already  stressing  about \n the  MRIs  I  had  to  get  done  the \n ultrasounds  I  had  to  get  done  my  doctor \n ordered  not  one  but  two  biopsies  and \n that  really  freaked  me  out  because  I've \n never  had  a  biopsy  done  oh  my  God  I'm \n sorry  I'm  having  a  hard  time  even \n talking  about  it  like  even  though  I  went \n through  all  of  this  already  it  still \n gives  me  such  Stress  and  Anxiety  even \n just  to  express  to  you  I  guess  to  give \n an  example  of  how  this  was  stressing  me \n out  some  nights  I  would  just  wake  up  in \n the  middle  of  the  night  feeling  so \n panicked  and  the  lump  in  my  chest  would \n start  hurting  and  then  I  would  just \n start  spiraling  because  I  genuinely \n thought  something  must  be  wrong  with  me \n if  I  had  to  undergo  all  of  these  tests \n if  you  don't  know  what  a  biopsy  is  they \n basically  inject  a  certain  area  of  your \n body  with  a  numbing  agent  so  let's  say \n your  chest  they  do  a  little  incision  a \n little  cut  and  then  they  put  in  this \n thicker  needle  that  is  supposed  to \n extract  tissue  samples  and  it's  usually \n like  four  to  six  tissue  samples  here's \n the  thing  there's  so  many  things  about \n biopsies  I  never  knew  and  I  wish  someone \n had  told  me  for  starters  when  they  take \n the  tissue  it  sounds  like  a  stapler  gun \n I  kid  you  not  I'm  lying  there  with  the \n doctor  going  beep  and  every  time  he \n takes  a  tissue  sample  it  sounds  like \n it's  frightening  luckily  I  can't  feel \n anything  cuz  I'm  numb  but  still  very \n frightening  and  then  after  a  biopsy  they \n put  in  a  small  metal  marker  into  your \n body  when  they  first  told  me  this  I  was \n like  M  no  I  think  not  I  would  not  like \n any  foreign  objects  permanently  plac  in \n my  body  what  do  you  mean  but  in  reality \n it's  actually  standard  procedure  and \n it's  really  good  that  they  do  this \n because  for  starters  the  little  piece  of \n metal  that  they  do  to  Mark  the  spot \n where  they  did  the  biopsy  it's  really \n really  tiny  it's  biocompatible  and  God \n forbid  if  your  results  are  concerning  in \n any  way  any  future  doctor  knows  exactly \n where  that  sample  was  taken  where  they \n might  need  to  do  surgery  so  overall  the \n markers  are  really  good  I  just  didn't \n know  about  them  and  finding  out  when \n you're  like  on  the  operating  table  that \n they're  going  to  put  a  metal  piece  in \n you  was  very  frightening  actually  I've \n got  so  overwhelmed  I  just  started  crying \n and  I  want  to  cry  now  you  just  talking \n about  it  but  I  also  really  don't  want  to \n cry  I've  cried  enough  on  camera \n throughout  my  years  of  being  a  content \n creator  we  don't  need  to  do  all  that  so \n I'll  try  to  keep  it  in  but  yes  I  was \n very  overwhelmed  because  this  such  a  new \n experience  you  could  say  because  you \n just  don't  know  how  worried  to  be  and \n especially  when  you  feel  like  you're \n having  done  a  kind  of  scary  procedure \n that  only  really  makes  you  think  like  oh \n something  scary  is  happening  to  my  body \n something  bad  is  going  on  but  really \n these  are  meant  to  be  tests  to  help  you \n just  find  out  more  information  but  yeah \n having  to  make  that  decision  last  minute \n about  the  markers  about  what  to  do \n really  freaked  me  out  I  rushed  to  call \n my  friend  who's  a  doctor  and  luckily \n they  reassured  me  and  then  they  texted \n me  everything  will  be  okay  and  that's \n actually  what  made  me  cry  I  also  highly \n recommend  for  my  second  biopsy  I  wound \n up  going  with  the  loved  one  that  helped \n so  so  so  so  much  so  that  biopsy  went \n well  I  got  the  results  and  luckily  it \n was  benign  which  means  non-cancerous \n however  I  still  had  to  get  a  second \n biopsy  and  this  one  was  an  MRI  assisted \n biopsy  on  another  part  of  my  chest  which \n means  not  only  are  they  cutting  me  open \n and  injecting  things  and  taking  things \n out  I'm  also  in  an  MRI  machine  if  you've \n never  gotten  an  MRI  good  for  you  you're \n literally  in  like  this  claustrophobic \n tube  with  these  sounds \n going  taking  Imaging  of  your  body  it's \n freakish  every  time  I've  had  to  get  a \n test  done  all  the  staff  and  employees \n were  so  nice  sometimes  they're  girls \n sometimes  they're  guys  it  doesn't  matter \n everybody  was  so  warm  and  comforting  and \n really  tried  their  best  to  make  sure \n that  I  was  comfortable  and  I  appreciate \n that  like  beyond  words  beyond  words  I \n appreciate  that  so \n [Music] \n much  I  really  appreciate  how  nice  all \n the  employees  are  it  makes  the  process  a \n little  bit  easier \n wish  me \n luck  this  time  it  was  two  guys  who  did \n my  MRI  and  they  were  really  young  but  I \n wasn't  uncomfortable  at  all  actually \n were  really  really  nice  ghost  to  show \n doesn't  matter  who's  your  nurse  they're \n probably  good  at  their  job  if  they  spent \n that  many  years  training  for \n you  oh  wow  so  between  each  test  was \n maybe  2  or  3  weeks  and  I'm  not  going  to \n lie  throughout  that  time  I  was  really \n just  trying  to  be  like  haha  everything's \n fine  this  is  fine  cuz  they  can't \n schedule  you  in  for  an  MRI  or  a  biopsy \n or  anything  as  soon  as  you  want  you  have \n to  wait  until  there's  an  opening  I \n really  thought  I  was  doing  a  good  job  at \n coping  but  it  wasn't  until  after  my \n second  biopsy  and  me  finally  getting  the \n results  a  few  days  later  that  I  realized \n holy  guac  I  was  holding  in  so  much \n stress  and  tension  and  concern  all  of \n these  weeks  it  was  just  building  up \n beneath  me  how  also  don't  know  why  I \n keep  coming  back  to  this  stupid  Park \n every  time \n emotional  I  just  feel  so \n overwhelmed  I'm \n like  these  tears  have  been  building  up \n in  me  for  weeks  luckily  when  I  finally \n got  the  results  of  my  second  biopsy  and \n it  said  they  were  benign  I  was  so \n relieved  and  I  was  able  to  really \n process  everything  cried  out  a  little \n bit  maybe  and  interestingly  enough  the \n results  actually  came  on  the  same  day  as \n my  mom's  birthday  so  it  was  a  nice  gift \n for  her  and \n me  I  was  kind  of  unsure  whether  to  share \n all  of  this  I  decided  I  wanted  to  for \n mainly  two  reasons  one  I  wish  I  had  seen \n someone  go  through  these  things  and  tell \n me  what  it  would  be  like  and  tell  me \n that  everything  would  be  okay  and  tell \n me  that  often  times  it's  standard \n procedure  and  it's  just  to  be  sure  and \n it's  good  to  be  sure  like  the  reality  of \n it  is  what  I  experienced  wasn't  just  a \n health  scare  it's  actually  kind  of  a \n routine  part  of  taking  care  of  yourself \n and  of  screening  for  things  as  early  as \n possible  which  brings  me  to  number  two  I \n have  family  members  who  have  had  breast \n cancer  I  have  PCOS  when  I  go  to  my \n gynecologist  I  can  see  in  my  folder \n bolded  High  lifetime  risk  of  breast \n cancer  and  that's  something  that  I  need \n to  accept  and  be  responsible  for  and \n part  of  being  responsible  means  getting \n screened  means  getting  tests  like  these \n done  routinely  or  whenever  it  need  be  it \n doesn't  have  to  be  a  bad  thing  I'm \n actually  so  lucky  that  I'm  able  to  get \n these  tests  done  that  I'm  able  to  God \n forbid  if  anything  was  wrong  likely  find \n out  really  early  on  ultimately  you \n always  want  to  catch  things  as  early  as \n possible  so  I  hope  this  can  serve  as \n encouragement  for  anyone  please  get \n tested  when  or  if  you  need  to  please \n stay  on  top  of  your  health  and  it's  just \n as  important  for  to  get  tested  for \n testicular  cancer  prostate  cancer  really \n any  type  of  cancer  that  your  doctors \n might  be  concerned  about  no  matter  who \n you  are  please  take  good  care  of  your \n health  it's  something  that  frankly  we \n can't  buy  back  health  is  wealth  and \n moments  like  these  really  really  make  me \n realize  that  nothing  else  matters  thank \n you  guys  for  watching  and  we'll  see  you \n in  the  next  one \n
