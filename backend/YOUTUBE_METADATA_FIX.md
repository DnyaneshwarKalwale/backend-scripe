# YouTube Video Metadata & Proxy Integration Fix

## Problem Analysis

The user reported that YouTube video duration was not showing correctly, even though yt-dlp was working for transcript fetching. After analysis, I found:

1. **yt-dlp was working correctly** - The transcript endpoint was successfully fetching video metadata including duration
2. **The issue was in the channel videos endpoint** - It was using RSS feeds (which don't include duration) and basic scraping without proxy support
3. **Proxy was not being used for video metadata** - Only transcript fetching used the proxy configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced YouTube Controller (`src/controllers/youtubeController.js`)

**Added new imports:**
```javascript
const { getHttpProxyConfig, getYtDlpProxyOptions } = require('../config/proxy');
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const util = require('util');
const execPromise = util.promisify(exec);
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const VideoTranscript = require('../models/videoTranscriptModel');
```

**Added two new helper functions:**

#### `fetchVideoMetadataWithYtDlp(videoId)`
- Uses yt-dlp with full proxy support
- Fetches complete video metadata (duration, title, channel, views, upload date, thumbnail)
- Uses the same proxy configuration as transcript fetching
- Includes proper error handling and logging

#### `fetchVideoMetadataWithScraping(videoId)`
- Fallback method using HTTP scraping with proxy
- Uses multiple regex patterns to extract duration
- Includes proxy support via axios configuration
- More reliable than the previous basic scraping approach

### 2. Updated Video Processing Logic

**Before:**
- Used basic scraping without proxy
- Only extracted duration using simple regex
- Processed 10 videos per batch
- No comprehensive metadata extraction

**After:**
- **Primary method**: yt-dlp with proxy support
- **Fallback method**: Enhanced scraping with proxy
- Processes 5 videos per batch (more suitable for yt-dlp)
- Extracts complete metadata and updates video objects
- Includes progress logging and success rate tracking
- Adds delays between batches to avoid overwhelming servers

### 3. Proxy Integration

The solution now uses the existing proxy configuration (`src/config/proxy.js`) for:

- **yt-dlp commands**: Using `getYtDlpProxyOptions()`
- **HTTP requests**: Using `getHttpProxyConfig()` for axios
- **Consistent proxy usage**: Same proxy for both transcript and metadata fetching

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- Graceful fallback from yt-dlp to scraping
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Progress tracking and success rate reporting
- Preserves existing video data if metadata fetching fails

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Duration**: Uses yt-dlp's reliable metadata extraction
2. **Proxy Support**: All video scraping now uses proxy configuration
3. **Better Success Rate**: Dual-method approach (yt-dlp + scraping fallback)
4. **Complete Metadata**: Fetches title, duration, channel, views, thumbnails
5. **Consistent Architecture**: Uses same proxy setup as transcript fetching
6. **Improved Logging**: Better debugging and monitoring capabilities

## Testing

Created `test-video-metadata.js` for testing the new functionality:

```bash
cd backend-scripe/backend
node test-video-metadata.js
```

This will test:
- yt-dlp binary detection
- Proxy configuration
- Cookie file usage
- Metadata extraction
- Performance metrics

## Configuration

The proxy settings are controlled in `src/config/proxy.js`:

```javascript
const PROXY_CONFIG = {
  host: 'res-ww.lightningproxies.net',
  port: '9999',
  username: 'nvizglwiborhznm163317-zone-lightning',
  password: 'nuuxkavzjt',
  enabled: true  // Set to false to disable proxy globally
};
```

## Usage

The fix is automatically applied to the existing `/api/youtube/channel` endpoint. When fetching channel videos:

1. RSS feed provides basic video information
2. For each video, the system attempts to fetch metadata using yt-dlp with proxy
3. If yt-dlp fails, it falls back to enhanced scraping with proxy
4. Videos are processed in batches with proper delays
5. Complete metadata is returned including accurate durations

## Files Modified

1. `src/controllers/youtubeController.js` - Main fix implementation
2. `test-video-metadata.js` - New test script (created)
3. `YOUTUBE_METADATA_FIX.md` - This documentation (created)

## Expected Results

- ✅ Video durations will now show correctly (e.g., "3:33", "10:45")
- ✅ All video metadata scraping uses proxy support
- ✅ Better success rate for fetching video information
- ✅ Consistent proxy usage across all YouTube operations
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging

The solution maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving the reliability and accuracy of YouTube video metadata fetching.
